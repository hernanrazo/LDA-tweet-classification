"@ylecun @IRudyak no, i've been saying that for a very long time, and it is an obvious analogy (which is why we both ended up talking about it). It's why I always say we are interested in systems neuroscience (or the top two levels of Marr) at DeepMind not the implementation details of the brain"

@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy Jonathan Uesato wrote the paper introducing it
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy (With the early stopping you won’t actually run for the full 1000 for most examples, so this experiment is not as expensive as it sounds)"
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy 2nd most important is the number of iterations, definitely try at least 1000"
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy Most important hyperparameter is early_stop_loss_thresh = 0. This makes it terminate when it finds a misclassification, rather than running for some fixed number of steps"
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy You definitely need to do some hyperparameter search to make it a good adaptive attack. But it should get an undefended model to 0 easily
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy I was working on streamlining the process as of when I left Google but I didn’t finish it: https://t.co/3NcdTUcu85
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy So to be clear: (1) I haven’t been involved in CleverHans development since March and I don’t know about the future module (2) I haven’t used or developed any of the pytorch code
@ChrSzegedy @ch402 I don’t mean the previous tweet as a criticism of any existing paper. I mean it as an explanation of why I don’t think it’s a priority to publish the red-releasing checklist
"@ch402 @ChrSzegedy Also, the checklist is mostly about expectimax adversarial examples. A static model that passes this checklist would still be worthless in practice. I encourage to switch to studying the dynamic case: https://t.co/b5XgyGi3KS"
@ch402 @ChrSzegedy The Google internal release checklist was (is?) much more specific (down to hyperparameter values that must be included) but my co-authors of the public doc didn’t want to get that specific.
@ch402 @ChrSzegedy We wrote this doc in collaboration with other labs: https://t.co/4VK6tdC9km
@ChrSzegedy In general it would be much better if authors of the first defense paper would follow the recommendations here: https://t.co/NfZA9hbXEa Many ideas that seem to work for direct PGD attacks and transferred PGD are then easily broken by SPSA or random search.
"@ChrSzegedy It looks like they did not evaluate using the SPSA attack, which would have been required before getting pubapproved from my team at Google, as of when I left. They also didn't evaluate on noise / random search. Both are standard ways to test the defense isn't gradient masking."
"@ChrSzegedy Yes, I acknowledge maybe a new twist makes it work. But in this field nearly all apparent positive results are false, so I’d be skeptical a priori. I’d be interested in an independent evaluation."
@ChrSzegedy Yes
@ChrSzegedy BN certainly *helps* training but little tiny MNIST models like this don’t need much help to train successfully
@ChrSzegedy It’s pretty easy to train networks that apply 1-D tent activation functions to linear transformations. It’s hard to train networks with tent functions that check for match to a high dimensional centroid.
"@ChrSzegedy I mean I used the tent activation, which is their newly proposed defense. AFAICT they don't say batch norm is part of the defense, just something needed to use to train the network effectively. I was able to train networks with tent activation without batch norm."
"@ChrSzegedy I tried exactly this in 2014 and it didn’t work. There’s a small chance they got it to work using a new subtle twist but most likely, as with nearly all defense papers, the attacks used in the evaluation aren’t strong enough. Interested to see an independent evaluation"

@vaibhavsinha75 Do you mean Kotler finds support for the idea of psychological barriers in multiple sports?
"@AndrewCutler13 @gwern (In case it isn’t clear, I 100% believe in genetic effects and don’t need any convincing that they’re large)"
"@gwern My intro to psych class at Stanford said people will say line A is longer than line B if everyone else in the room says so, even when line B is clearly longer. Is that BS too?"
@gwern There’s also a weird self-confirming property of the claim. If we say Rosenthal only showed that experimenter bias has a strong effect because he was biased against genetic explanations... we’re saying that experimenter bias had a strong effect.
@gwern I have to say I still feel pretty biased toward believing this one. “PhD students tend to show the outcome they know their advisor wants” is just such a plausible claim / fits in with the rest of the replication process.
@gwern What are the deeper incentives? Can psychology departments / journals expect to keep getting funding if nothing they produce is correct?
@gwern That’s sad but I get what you’re saying now. The replication crisis isn’t changing the journals’ priorities or shifting attention to non-journal venues? Sounds like psychology needs to move to open review.
@gwern Thanks. That’s useful information. There’s never been a negative reproduction though? I’d think that a lot of people would be eager to make a name for themselves refuting a famous result
@gwern I’ll believe you that that was his motivation for doing the study. But isn’t it possible that *both* genetics and priming effects affect rat performance? My question is specifically about the priming effects
"@gwern Yeah, I didn’t think it was endorsement. Just surprised to end up interacting with the person hosting"
@gwern I think the paper I’m asking about is this one: https://t.co/gpu2EaDNvO (hosted on your website???) and I think it doesn’t mention Tryon. Are you saying this Rosenthal paper was just a 1960s subtweet of Tryon?
@gwern Thanks. The content of the talk page seems to be about a different issue though. I’m not asking about whether Tryon’s results were caused by priming.
@gwern @AndrewCutler13 Thanks. So you’re saying the “maze bright” / “maze dull” experiment has been repeated without reproducing the result?

Question for psychology experts of twitter: do the “bright” rats *actually perform* better because the PhD students treat them better? Or do the PhD students report higher scores to fit their advisor’s expectations? Or both? https://t.co/QLT59GCNq8
There’s a famous result in psychology where grad students report that rats are better at mazes if the advisor tells them the rats are “maze bright” rather than “maze dull”.
"@BruceTedesco More computation and data has made it possible to solve problems involving high resolution images, etc, but in 2006-2012 most deep learning researchers were working on tiny problems that are now easy to solve with the amount of computation and training data available back then."
@daniel_bilar In 2006 if you believed in neural nets then results like Geoff Hinton’s deep belief nets were reason for hope. But even those were based on the idea that supervised deep nets were hopeless and had to be propped up with unsupervised learning.
@daniel_bilar When I took my first intro to AI class in 2006 there were no neural nets in the class. At the end of the class I asked the instructor why there were no neural nets because I had expected them to be a core part of AI. He told me they turned out not to work / weren’t worth covering
@Hassle_J I owned the same personal computer / GPU throughout all of my PhD. By the time I graduated it was easy to solve problems that I believed were unlikely to be possible for purely supervised ML at the start of my PhD.
"@Hassle_J When I started grad school, the big academic debate in my area was “is supervised deep learning broken because of local minima or because of overfitting?” It turned out it was neither."
I think that barriers to the success of deep learning before 2012 were largely psychological and have previously used the 4 minute mile story as an analogy to explain it. So this surprises me.
"For years I’ve believed in the story that after the first person ran a 4 minute mile, suddenly many other athletes found that they could too, and that the 4 minute barrier was largely psychological. Today I found this article arguing that’s a myth: https://t.co/cb2z7nuluP"

@ylecun @tdietterich Large community size can indicate low barriers to entry. Sometimes barriers to entry don’t have anything to do with the value of the field. ML people have no reason to be proud that a GPU is cheaper than an MRI machine.
@ylecun @tdietterich Large *research* community size can indicate that a field is young more than than it is influential.
"@ylecun @tdietterich Large community size can be something to be proud of if it’s caused by high influence or a democratic attitude, which I think is the case for the ML community. But..."

"@killroy42 That's certainly a thing people do! Unfortunately, I'm not sure that we understand how training against, say, gaussian noise generalizes to other kinds of robustness very well yet."
"This suggests an alternative interpretation: Perhaps the adversarial directions just strongly correlated in parameter space with a true useful feature. When you fit to them, you get the useful feature, and vice versa."
Clearly the adversarial directions aren't a linear feature. The model is interpolating some more complicated feature from each adversarial direction.
"... On more consideration, I'm a little less persuaded that (3) is strong evidence for adversarial examples being intrinsic to the data."
"@profillic Hello! I think Gradient Science is the blog of that research group, which I'm not a part of -- but I agree that it's nice!

"@jh_jacobsen Also, just at a practical level, adversarial training is expensive and tricky to really implement correctly."
"@jh_jacobsen Online vs offline is one big difference. But I think there's actually a deeper one:

Adversarial training creates counterexamples, penalizing the model for sensitivity. In contrast, this is trying to create a dataset where those features were never present in the first place."
"This does seem like non-trivial evidence for adversarial examples being genuine features of the data, rather than properties of our models or training set quirks.

Caveat to all of this: Adversarial examples are not my domain of expertise and I haven't read this super carefully!"
"(3) The other interesting result is that you can create a different dataset of adversarial attacks, where you try to predict the attack class.

They find this model - trained on adversarial attacks - generalizes to clean data, which I probably wouldn’t have predicted in advance. https://t.co/ood8JL1dVy"
"I say claim because I’ve learned to not believe any robustness claim until people like Nicholas Carlini have taken a shot at breaking it!

Note that this isn’t a robustness free lunch -- you still need to create the original robust model through adversarial training."
"(2) The claim which will seems to me really remarkable if it holds up is that you can use this process to turn robust models into robust datasets, for which normal training creates robust models. https://t.co/WwC4okBahs"
"They’re basically using this to try and filter the dataset through the model’s features. It almost feels a bit like model distillation, but to a dataset.

(The method is vaguely similar in technique to Gerhos et al’s “Stylized ImageNet”, but feels pretty different.)"
(1) The most striking thing to me is actually a new method in their paper: creating new datasets by projecting examples into a network's representation and then doing feature inversion. https://t.co/ntaaK8VhBi

@DrHughHarvey @emmabluemke @openminedorg Snorkel is looking to address these issues around auto annotation. Also the scalability of annotation (and really annotation in general) is mostly tangential. Ex: biobank data. Annotated once. Used for statistical analysis many times. The latter is where privacy tech applies

"Final OpenAI Five stats:

- Competitive: 7,215 wins, 42 losses (99.4% winrate, 15,019 total players)
- Cooperative: 35,466 games (18,689 total players)

gg all!

@egrefen Yep both are important factors! But I don't think the author of the article would disagree.
"“The community has retreated to mechanical skill as a way to rationalize our inferiority. ... Or else we would have to admit that these machines are also besting us in Dota with traits that are innately human: insight, intuition, and creativity.” https://t.co/uCt0XIKNQX"
@bons_vincent They’re not fundamentally difficult — they just were never our top priority since it seemed like we could better improve our performance other ways. So you can think of anything scripted as the parts of Dota we think matter least.
"@OneSirMeow Five already does adjust automatically between patches, as described here: https://t.co/hGc54ez7kl"
@rocanaan It’s learned — though item purchases such as wards are scripted!
"One counterpoint: our scripted components are a clear weakness that won’t change with training.

But that’s just a handicap. There are still *many* aspects of the game, like invisibility, which are learnable.

Our experience tells us never to discount the power of more training."
"When we lost at The International (100% vs pro teams), they said it was because Five can’t do strategy.

So we trained for longer.

When we lose (0.7% vs the entire Internet), they say it’s because Five can’t adapt.

If we train for longer...???

🥳🎓 It only took me 10 minutes to figure out how to see other people's reviews in Softconf / START! #nlpmvp 🤗 https://t.co/9xoJKJ7MdY
"@earnmyturns @ryandcotterell @redpony @adinamwilliams Yeah, even with the z we convinced ourselves these are not context sensitive in the same way as indexed-grammars for the reason Fernando mentions."
"@akiross @harvardnlp Thanks, let me know if you have any suggestions."
"Damn, some days being an academic is so interesting. This is such a clear overview describing the stakes of inducing hierarchy in language and the recent intellectual history of this challenge. https://t.co/d1entpvGan"
"@nsaphra @ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick Ah, this is quite an interesting point. One reading of this argument is that, in addition to our parameterization, we are really benefiting from SGD/Adam as the regularizer here. Or more so that embeddings + SGD work well in combination."
Code here: https://t.co/uugVacPEDh
"@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick We did not try EM by ""coordinate descent with alternating global GD on parameters and DP for marginals"". It's really slow to implement in toolkits, and the win seems minor. SGD over DP has the same objective and feels like a fair, batched modern incarnation of that technique."
@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick We had long conversations about the history of eval metrics for this task. Binary branching constituency trees was the only one Yoon was convinced about (there is a *lot* of footnoted discussion in the paper).
@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick https://t.co/uugVacPEDh
"@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick Yeah, that paper stuck with me as well. The story of parameterization/features in unsupervised learning is still confusing to me."
"@ryandcotterell Right. The unintuitive part is how well a vanilla log marginal-likelihood (not conditional?, although that might be terminology). This is roughly an embedding version of @BergKirkpatrick's ""Painless Unsupervised Learning with Features"" paper https://t.co/aM2I3DSKII."
@JidinDinesh @zzznah We're still working on it. I'm still convinced this would be super helpful.

https://t.co/0cAlRXgBtz"
"@boknilev @gneubig Notable for the back and forth with the author.
https://t.co/Y7nnVGBdZF"
@boknilev @gneubig That's a really good idea. Here's are some that were called out by ACs:
"@PSalajka @tradewindturb @harvardnlp Yeah, that's right. We reinitialize everything, so it is okay, but some of the pytorch folks suggested not doing this."
"What's interesting is that the *model* is not deep. But the *inference* really is. This is not a new point, but it was somewhat surprising to me given the history of this problem."
These compound/bayesian models perform much better and push the state-of-the-art on some on these parsing tasks. You can even see how the latent state causes the same treelet structure to cover different lexical realizations. https://t.co/jU3CBxyvFb
"The next experiment considers latent-variable CFGs, e.g Berkeley parser, that create richer grammars that learn broader dependencies. Modern systems can incorporate lv with amortized VI / VAE. These approaches play nicely and you can collapse even tree-inference while sampling. https://t.co/PTbDWVSqzG"
"The first experiment in this work revisits this question. It replicates the common wisdom that ""MLE for PCFGs"" is broken, but finds that even simple param factorization, ""EM for neural CFGs"" (embed non-terminals) works pretty well by itself, when trained with backprop. https://t.co/bUjMKd86vD"
"This problem sparked a whole research direction of methods that ""adjusted"" the unsupervised objective through priors, regularization, features, and objective ""modifications""... I love these papers, but they rest on this core assumption that ""MLE for PCFGs is bad""."
"During this period conventional wisdom in the field was that, while a really nice pedagogical exercise, EM did not work for this problem. The trees were just not good, and presumably the MLE solution for PCFGs was just bad (although it is provably intractable to check)."
"In the mid 2000s, there was significant interest in NLP in unsupervised parsing, e.g. how to induce a tree representation from text. Many approaches used some variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) to induce a context free grammar (PCFG), as taught in an intro ML class."
"Yoon's ACL paper ""Compound Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars for Grammar Induction"": https://t.co/Vk1NCZP2ty : This is a ""deep learning"" paper, but these days the line between learning and inference in NLP is becoming pretty interesting... (thread)"
"@PSalajka @harvardnlp Oh actually this code has dangerous sharing semantics, you should probably not use it.  I am in the process of doing a version 2 of the blog post that fixes this and make it more pytorch-onic."
"@math_rachel @hugo_larochelle @zeynep Glad you liked the talk. Yeah, discretion is up to the speaker here, I assume she decided not to post it."
"@nlpmattg @nasrinmmm The part I find intellectually confusing is what ""adversarial data collection"" means. Once you bring a model into the dataset, why is the adversary fixed to one point in time? I get the practical concerns, but not the argument that ""you have to start somewhere"" with simple q."
@nlpmattg @nasrinmmm Cool. So would you recommend waiting for Drop 2: The Return?
"@nlpmattg @nasrinmmm It would be great if it turns into a program induction data set. What % do you think is interesting, e.g. non-trivially / combinatorially compositional? 10%? 20%?"
"@nasrinmmm Good q. This dataset requires mathematical/set based operations. In theory, these would be open-class. In practice the baseline implemented 4 specialized ""symbolic heads"" that answered several of these. This submission adds a couple more operations. A bit unsatisfying to me."
Some of our amazing undergrads pushed the DROP baseline by about 20 points: https://t.co/MhTjsgkZhV . This dataset is a bit frustrating though. It feels like it should be off-limits to use explicit symbolic reasoning (no idea how to enforce that). https://t.co/UaDvlbLSM9
"@roboticwrestler Ugh, the replies to this are pretty condescending. It's a tough problem, and hard to fix without developing silly distance/status markers."
@JoshJonesNE Might be interesting to do a survey of how people are actually using generation in practice. Not sure I really know how these services work. I've heard that customer service like this is a huge application of NLP.
@Eric_Wallace_ Definitely a topic we are actively thinking about (https://t.co/y7FoSJf9hc / pseudo-self attention). Maybe I'll write up our current findings.
"@guitaricet One of my favorite topics. Still waiting for the quintessential text vae paper. current papers are interesting, but not super impressive yet. Would be a fun blog post though."
@grad_ascent that's a good idea... there is still a lot of confusion around these methods..
"With my grad students off to summer camp, was thinking of writing some new blog posts / open-source tools. Any ideas or requests? Topics of general current NLP interest that are scary / complex / hard-to-implement for students."

@natefoster At the time the numerical computing landscape was just not mature enough. Now it seems like typed / functional programming is ideal for modern deep learning workflows. (Although probably not the community)
"^ Psyched to have Greg Morrisett as a new dean. One of my favorite teachers. Inspired a strong interest in tools for safe and robust programming, and a (probably unhealthy) period of writing NLP systems in OCaml / Haskell."
"https://t.co/BhuS7Kydfa: “As New York City becomes an increasingly important technology hub, we want to help make sure it’s inclusive, representative of a broad range of disciplines and avoids some of the problems we’ve seen emerge as technology becomes more central to our lives”"

"@Thom_Wolf @seb_ruder @mattthemathman @swabhz It's an open question what the tradeoff should be. Why nn.MultiHeadAttn and not just nn.Attn? Are modularizes for efficiency, minimality, popularity? A lesson of LSTM is that we used a weird module simply because it had a fast impl. The pytorch folks have great intuition here."
"@Thom_Wolf @seb_ruder @mattthemathman @swabhz Less sarcastically, there is an interesting trade-off between built-ins versus language structure, particularly for research code that needs to change internals. For example, curious what the current LoC is for the ""from primitives"" implementation."

@cal_promo Only if love carries no energy-momentum.
"We don't know for sure, of course. (Quantum gravity is hard.) But it's another illustration of the interplay between traditional fundamental physics and quantum foundations. An interplay that is currently neglected, hopefully not for long!"
"The traditional thought was that there were an infinite number worlds in Everettian quantum theory. But gravity seems to provide a cutoff on what states can possibly exist, rendering the total number of worlds finite."
"Getting into the weeds here, as the book wraps up. Many-Worlds and gravity have important consequences for each other. Many-Worlds helps us escape the reliance on classical structures that holds back quantum-gravity research; gravity places a limit on the total number of worlds."

"@dvs1444 Right. Which is why the notion emerges in individual semiclassical worlds, not in the global wave function."
"And along the way I point out that Many-Worlds has huge advantages over other approaches when it comes to emergent spacetime. Other ideas (spontaneous collapse, hidden variables) make ""location in space"" fundamental. Not a good idea if spacetime itself is quantum."
I argue that taking the foundations of quantum mechanics seriously leads to new and important insights on the longstanding problem of quantum gravity. Hardly surprising. Why should we understand quantum gravity if we don't even understand quantum mechanics?

"@DCasBol Thanks for your interest @DCasBol ! Yes, it would be very nice to do this kind of training in multiple layers."

@mthiboust @PrincetonNeuro @Numenta The learning rules on slide 60 are very biological and seem to make perfect sense. Conceptually they are in the same “universality class” as the learning rules that we study. I would be curious to see some benchmarking of how they work. @SubutaiAhmad
@F_Vaggi @IBMResearch This is a standard benchmarking trick in ML. You require that the accuracy of the model does not change if you apply a random but fixed (for all data points) permutation of pixels to all the images in the training and the test sets.
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura Yup, I am."
"@Princeton @PrincetonNeuro @the_IAS Also, check out a blog from @IBMResearch and @MITIBMLab available here: https://t.co/UQoMisNEuH"
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura No, all the experiments in this paper use fully connected nets only. And completely agreed on the convolutions."
"@JWaschura @IBMResearch Backprop in one layer can be written as a local learning rule. We comment on this issue in the second paragraph of the discussion. You can also use a perceptron learning rule to train the top classifier, if you like. This should not change the results significantly."
"@F_Vaggi @IBMResearch Random weights work much worse. Also, the tasks that we studied are pixel permutation invariant, so we used fully connected nets only, no convolutions."
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura We tried training deeper networks with more than one hidden layer, but we did not see an improvement in accuracy compared to the networks with one hidden layer. This is perhaps because the datasets that we studied are very simple - pixel permutation invariant MNIST and CIFAR."
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura It took a couple of hours to produce weights for Fig.6 in the paper, but they were calculated in parallel on different CPUs."
@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura For all the experiments we used IBM’s DLAAS. The code that I posted on GitHub works best on a fast CPU. It is not optimized for speed. I just tried to make the notebook as simple and transparent as possible so that the theoretical idea behind the algorithm is clear.

@roydanroy Thanks! There are a couple of related works that we will cite in the next iteration. Main differences: We can now make it a metric as ImageNet trains in minutes (cheaply). Generative models are much better. And we evaluate a wider variety of models (not only GANs).

"Health technologies often frustrate clinicians. Qualitative interviews with nurses &amp; doctors using Streams were positive finding it saved 'lots of time', helped them 'do their job better' &amp; 'intervene on patients earlier than normally able to' (7/9) https://t.co/9i3L7RTVB8"
"Using Streams patients with AKI were reviewed by a kidney expert in an average of 15mins (vs many hours in standard care), less cases of AKI were missed (12.4 to 3.4%), treatment times improved and costs per patient reduced by 17% (£11772 to £9761) (6/9) https://t.co/NkYwR85ncQ"
In collaboration with colleagues from @ucl we publish 3 papers today in @Nature_NPJ Digital Medicine and @jmirpub that evaluate how Streams has impacted on clinicians &amp; patients @RoyalFreeNHS using the existing non-AI based AKI alert in widespread use across the NHS (5/9)
"However good any prediction, we can't help patients without tools that alert experts at the right time. Better technology is desperately needed by clinicians still reliant on pagers, which is why we built our secure mobile app Streams now in use by NHS nurses and doctors (4/9)"
"In research with colleagues @DeptVetAffairs published today in @nature, we demonstrate an AI system able to predict life-threatening AKI up to 2 days before it happens with 90% of all patients who went on to dialysis being correctly identified (3/9) https://t.co/Rx7dvbxngS"
"We've initially focused on the problem of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). Sudden damage to kidneys is common, easily missed &amp; without prompt treatment may lead to dialysis/transplant &amp; preventable deaths. Solutions that work for AKI should translate to other problems like sepsis (2/9)"

@drphiliplee1 @Allpowersphysio The wording suggests issue is lack of familiarity vs doctors being too busy. If it’s the latter not sure if a professional body petitioned for this change. Btw registered nurses are on approved list and they’re pretty busy
@Allpowersphysio I know - it's so much better! Just surprised that the only profession excluded are doctors for not reliably knowing the person they are being asked to sign for. Maybe someone at HM Passports had a bad experience..
You can now confirm counter signatory of UK passports online. It lists a couple of dozen professions authorised to do so inc chiropodists &amp; dentists.

@ivorinfo There should be a competition to see which hospitals do this this best. I always find floor signage at Paddington and Victoria stations helpful!
@sarahblake200 @JPHorwood @ATurner0 @amirhannan Yip I do think the article was a little one sided. Clear benefits have already come from digital health solutions. But patients and clinicians are reasonably inpatient for the types of technology and experience they have made such a difference in other areas of their lives
This article is a *must* read if you care about #digitalhealth. State of nation report covering systems usability &amp; contribution to medical errors &amp; burnout as well as continuing lack of interoperability &amp; patient access. Technology should help not hinder https://t.co/3PZYY7PG4r

@OmairShariq @schoolofsurgery @MarkarSheraz @MayoSurgEd Seems obvious that an employee will invest more in your training and wellbeing if you are there for long term vs 6months.

Struck by #match2019 and the difference to NHS training programmes.

"To add to Vincent's point above, new findings also include:

1. The method is general (works well for images &amp; texts).

2. The method works well on top of transfer learning (e.g., BERT).

You can find these results in Unsupervised Data Augmentation paper: https://t.co/J74Nn4i8no"
"@statwonk @GeorginaFlesia I don't understand your comment, but semi-supervised learning is different from semi-parametric. See my comment above about the key idea for an explanation. Please take a look at the papers as well."
"Key idea in these two papers is to ensure prediction(x) = prediction(x + noise) , where x is an unlabeled example.

People have tried all kind of noise, e.g., Gaussian noise, adversarial noise etc. But it looks like data augmentation noise is the real winner. https://t.co/ClUOqbvEsj"

"@msweeny I don't understand your question well, but the method is used in a semi-supervised learning where you have two losses. One is supervised loss and the other is unsupervised consistency loss. The figure below may help. https://t.co/oq7DZldYut"
"Results with Unsupervised Data Augmentation: It achieves SOTA on IMDb with 20 labeled examples (~1000x less labeled data than other methods), and achieves SOTA on CIFAR10 4k, SVHN 1k."
Key idea behind the method is consistency training: model prediction on an unlabeled example and model prediction on an *augmented* unlabeled example are consistent. This idea is also related to some recent papers and our own paper on Cross View Training: https://t.co/D2G4OPViuz
Data augmentation is often associated with supervised learning. We find *unsupervised* data augmentation works better. It combines well with transfer learning (e.g. BERT) and improves everything when datasets have a small number of labeled examples. Link: https://t.co/S3odxa6dVj https://t.co/4MevbqO6Xf

"@kchonyc Thanks for the reference. They have similar insights and the ""masked features"" idea seems close, but not sure I would call it a standard language model. Maybe closer to BERT?"
"@FelixHill84 Not exactly a standard language model as far as I can tell. Their models predict previous and next sentences given the current sentence. For that reason, they only embed a sentence, not arbitrary chunks of texts."
@gneubig Not exactly a standard language model but I see your point. Thanks for the reference and mentioning the paper in your class.
"Second, the idea of embedding words through a language model was proposed in our followup paper in 2016: https://t.co/tBuMPnfLeJ . (3/3) https://t.co/7pQz5mZLRP"

"Peters et al 2017 and 2018 (ELMo) get the credit for the discoveries of 1) Using language models for transfer learning and 2) Embedding words through a language model (""contextualized word vectors""). ELMo is great, but these methods were proposed earlier. (1/3)"
@nlpnoah Nice. But the idea of using pretrained language models AFAIK was first proposed by this paper https://t.co/etwZkkRgN2 (Also mentioned in Jacob's slides for the history around BERT: https://t.co/UECGNAk00b )
"Since our work on ""Semi-supervised sequence learning"", ELMo, BERT and others have shown changes in the algorithm give big accuracy gains. But now given these nice results with a vanilla language model, it's possible that a big factor for gains can come from scale. Exciting! https://t.co/fL4acZE2Cn"

"@yiming_lin__ Had a long discussion with @jjding99 and others about this (see my replies to comments on my original tweet) - in short, I agree specificity re: FR vs surveillance etc. is important, and I should have been more caveated in the original tweet re: not being sure what the tower is"

"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Again, vagueness is the enemy here. They could e.g. say that something is not CCTV+FR integration for a zillion reasons"
@jjding99 @dryellowbean I’d have to know more about HK law/culture etc to know if that statement can be taken at face value.
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Oh also: I am extra skeptical bc it was a backwards looking statement (nothing about future plans), months ago. But would still be skeptical of a vague claim today."
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean It seems like we don’t have a ton of hard data to go on, just contextualizing why I am unimpressed :)"
@jjding99 @dryellowbean I regularly see police lie or mislead about FR
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Interesting, we have v diff interpretations of that statement :) Especially in the context of policing, one should not rely on vague statements as a source of ground truth - and the denial of the follow up request basically obviates the significance of the first statement"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean I think it is reasonable for protesters to think that surveillance tower feeds or still images could be run through FR (and, if it actually were a FR tower, even more so) given what I currently know about HK police statements/actions and general priors re: policing in a crisis"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Hmm yeah in retrospect FR tower seems like overly strong language (without more info) and I’d be more comfortable with eg surveillance towers as a default term here. But I have not looked into it enough to be confident that isn’t FR related, and unless it is literally a dummy, +"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean To some extent I am transferring my priors from other cases, and maybe that’s inappropriate. But that is a super duper weak statement by the standards of such statements, and similar statements routinely turn out to be false."
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean (Given developments elsewhere, HK govt’s non stirling track record of transparency as I understand it, and the ample wiggle room in that statement, and the crisis situation - I don’t get much trust from that statement)"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean I don’t see any tension between the tweet and this, but maybe misunderstanding! They denied the request for more info - unsurprising. They deny a certain very specific claim re integration of CCTV and FR - unsurprising."
@dryellowbean @jjding99 Hmm def not something I have expertise in! More familiar with Western FR developments generally/haven’t looked as closely at the HK situation as I’d ideally like
@wsisaac Glad it isn’t just me!

@jjding99 @pfau Maybe they meant the same thing though - not sure
"@jjding99 @pfau Yeah, and I also didn’t mean to endorse the tweet I quoted (which maybe implied it was a FR tower, but to me that distinction is not key so didn’t register as in need of clarification)"
"@jjding99 @pfau So the lack of known bad uses seems somewhat orthogonal to protesters being concerned about ubiquitous sources of surveillance data, regardless whether there is processing occurs onboard or offboard those devices, or whether all footage is processed in this way... thoughts?"
"@jjding99 @pfau Oh, I remember that article now, did read it actually. I did not come away very optimistic. It seems that, similarly to the West, use of FR is super opaque and unaccountable."

"@timnitGebru But guerrilla members going back to war just makes the party in gov stronger, as Uribe has built his entire career on warmongering. It also benefits all who profit financially and politically from war."
"@timnitGebru That’s in part true: the current gov (managed behind the scenes by Uribe) has been trying to drag us back to war. They campaigned against the peace deal during the referendum (and won), and have tried to change key aspects of what was agreed upon."
"@timnitGebru Oh, interesting, I haven't read that take. I've been following news in Spanish so I'll try to find things in English to share. Short update: This morning four of the top leaders announced that they are going back to war because the gov has not kept their side of the deal."

"@gupta__abhay Hmm but would GDPR apply if the person 'chooses' to include that, and it cannot be determined if it factors into a (non-algorithmic) decision? It seems like regulation cannot determine what people 'choose' to share, and instead that has to change through defying conventions."
@nagpalchirag Agreed! And the increasing use of LinkedIn as a replacement for CVs is turning that into the norm.

Beautifully articulated. The one that really hit home for me is 13. I’ve noticed that my ability to trust and bond with someone is heavily predicated on whether they are internally driven.
