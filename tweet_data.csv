Congratulations to the amazing Lee Sedol and #AlphaGo team for an unbelievable 5-game match that will go down in history...
#AlphaGo wins game 5! One of the most incredible games ever. To comeback from the initial big mistake against Lee Sedol was mind-blowing!!!
#AlphaGo made a bad mistake early in the game (it didnt know a known tesuji) but now it is trying hard to claw it back... nail-biting.
Game 5 begins... Lee Sedol vs #AlphaGo https://t.co/L6nL3ebT7I
Game 5 starting in 30 mins: going to be really exciting to see if Lee Sedol can exploit the weakness in #AlphaGo’s play he found in game 4
"The neural nets were trained through self-play so there will be gaps in their knowledge, which is why we are here: to test AlphaGo the limit"
"This meant that all the prior searching #AlphaGo had done was rendered useless, and for a while it misevaluated the highly complex position"
"Taken a quick look at the logs: AlphaGo gave a probability of &lt;1 in 10000 for Lee's brilliant move 78, so AG found this move very surprising"
"Final game 5 starting in a few hours: 13:00 KST (local), 04:00 GMT, 20:00 PT. Livestream: https://t.co/NOhkY0XVQe Should be epic! #AlphaGo"
Just shows how deeply complex Go is. Lee Sedol's move 78 in Game 4 and move 37 by #AlphaGo in Game 2 will be discussed for a very long time
"Lee Sedol is currently trending worldwide at no. 1, and also 7 and 9. Huge congratulations to him again! #AlphaGo https://t.co/1weFX0wDcS"
Lee Sedol wins game 4!!! Congratulations! He was too good for us today and pressured #AlphaGo into a mistake that it couldn’t recover from
When I say 'thought' and 'realisation' I just mean the output of #AlphaGo value net. It was around 70% at move 79 and then dived on move 87
"Mistake was on move 79, but #AlphaGo only came to that realisation on around move 87"
"Lee Sedol is playing brilliantly! #AlphaGo thought it was doing well, but got confused on move 87. We are in trouble now..."
Game 4 about to start shortly. Livestream here: https://t.co/Mt0R6TqShl I'm rooting for the genius that is Lee Sedol for this game :)
"#AlphaGo won game 3 and the match! Historic moment. In complete awe of Lee Sedol’s incredible genius, and proud of the amazing AlphaGo team!"
Distributed version is only ~75% win rate against single machine version! Using distributed for match but single machine AG very strong also
Our neural network training algorithms are more important to #AlphaGo performance than the hardware it uses to play (see the Nature paper)
We are using roughly same amount of compute power as in Fan Hui match: distributing search over further machines has diminishing returns
Game 3 starting in an hour! livestream here: https://t.co/EWAk0GwMED also live on national TV in China (CCTV) and Korea (KBS)
"Just to clarify, the match is being played under standard Chinese rules with no restrictions on how either player can play of course!"
"#AlphaGo wins match 2, to take a 2-0 lead!! Hard for us to believe. AlphaGo played some beautiful creative moves in this game. Mega-tense..."
"Lee Sedol entering overtime. #AlphaGo confident, but top pro player commentators divided. Excruciatingly nerve-wracking :)"
"Just been told 60m viewers watched the first match online just in China! 100m+ worldwide inc. TV, 3300 news articles just in Korea. Amazing!"

"@gwern @dwf I support barriers as a solution with greater than zero effectiveness, but I absolutely do not want UofT to say “we put up some barriers” and call it a day. This has to be one of many solution methods, and so far I don’t see any sign that that’s the plan."
@gwern @dwf You seem to be insisting that we use the word “actual” to mean “anything that has greater than zero effectiveness” when in fact we are using the word to mean “sufficient” or “acceptable”

@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy Jonathan Uesato wrote the paper introducing it
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy (With the early stopping you won’t actually run for the full 1000 for most examples, so this experiment is not as expensive as it sounds)"
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy 2nd most important is the number of iterations, definitely try at least 1000"
"@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy Most important hyperparameter is early_stop_loss_thresh = 0. This makes it terminate when it finds a misclassification, rather than running for some fixed number of steps"
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy You definitely need to do some hyperparameter search to make it a good adaptive attack. But it should get an undefended model to 0 easily
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy I was working on streamlining the process as of when I left Google but I didn’t finish it: https://t.co/3NcdTUcu85
@AndrasRozsa1 @ChrSzegedy So to be clear: (1) I haven’t been involved in CleverHans development since March and I don’t know about the future module (2) I haven’t used or developed any of the pytorch code
@ChrSzegedy @ch402 I don’t mean the previous tweet as a criticism of any existing paper. I mean it as an explanation of why I don’t think it’s a priority to publish the red-releasing checklist
"@ch402 @ChrSzegedy Also, the checklist is mostly about expectimax adversarial examples. A static model that passes this checklist would still be worthless in practice. I encourage to switch to studying the dynamic case: https://t.co/b5XgyGi3KS"
@ch402 @ChrSzegedy The Google internal release checklist was (is?) much more specific (down to hyperparameter values that must be included) but my co-authors of the public doc didn’t want to get that specific.
@ch402 @ChrSzegedy We wrote this doc in collaboration with other labs: https://t.co/4VK6tdC9km
@ChrSzegedy In general it would be much better if authors of the first defense paper would follow the recommendations here: https://t.co/NfZA9hbXEa Many ideas that seem to work for direct PGD attacks and transferred PGD are then easily broken by SPSA or random search.
"@ChrSzegedy It looks like they did not evaluate using the SPSA attack, which would have been required before getting pubapproved from my team at Google, as of when I left. They also didn't evaluate on noise / random search. Both are standard ways to test the defense isn't gradient masking."
"@ChrSzegedy Yes, I acknowledge maybe a new twist makes it work. But in this field nearly all apparent positive results are false, so I’d be skeptical a priori. I’d be interested in an independent evaluation."
@ChrSzegedy Yes
@ChrSzegedy BN certainly *helps* training but little tiny MNIST models like this don’t need much help to train successfully
@ChrSzegedy It’s pretty easy to train networks that apply 1-D tent activation functions to linear transformations. It’s hard to train networks with tent functions that check for match to a high dimensional centroid.
"@ChrSzegedy I mean I used the tent activation, which is their newly proposed defense. AFAICT they don't say batch norm is part of the defense, just something needed to use to train the network effectively. I was able to train networks with tent activation without batch norm."
"@ChrSzegedy I tried exactly this in 2014 and it didn’t work. There’s a small chance they got it to work using a new subtle twist but most likely, as with nearly all defense papers, the attacks used in the evaluation aren’t strong enough. Interested to see an independent evaluation"

"@AndrewCutler13 @gwern (In case it isn’t clear, I 100% believe in genetic effects and don’t need any convincing that they’re large)"
"@gwern My intro to psych class at Stanford said people will say line A is longer than line B if everyone else in the room says so, even when line B is clearly longer. Is that BS too?"
@gwern There’s also a weird self-confirming property of the claim. If we say Rosenthal only showed that experimenter bias has a strong effect because he was biased against genetic explanations... we’re saying that experimenter bias had a strong effect.
@gwern I have to say I still feel pretty biased toward believing this one. “PhD students tend to show the outcome they know their advisor wants” is just such a plausible claim / fits in with the rest of the replication process.
@gwern What are the deeper incentives? Can psychology departments / journals expect to keep getting funding if nothing they produce is correct?
@gwern That’s sad but I get what you’re saying now. The replication crisis isn’t changing the journals’ priorities or shifting attention to non-journal venues? Sounds like psychology needs to move to open review.
@gwern Thanks. That’s useful information. There’s never been a negative reproduction though? I’d think that a lot of people would be eager to make a name for themselves refuting a famous result
@gwern I’ll believe you that that was his motivation for doing the study. But isn’t it possible that *both* genetics and priming effects affect rat performance? My question is specifically about the priming effects
"@gwern Yeah, I didn’t think it was endorsement. Just surprised to end up interacting with the person hosting"
@gwern I think the paper I’m asking about is this one: https://t.co/gpu2EaDNvO (hosted on your website???) and I think it doesn’t mention Tryon. Are you saying this Rosenthal paper was just a 1960s subtweet of Tryon?
@gwern Thanks. The content of the talk page seems to be about a different issue though. I’m not asking about whether Tryon’s results were caused by priming.
@gwern @AndrewCutler13 Thanks. So you’re saying the “maze bright” / “maze dull” experiment has been repeated without reproducing the result?
"@MEetvelde @daniel_bilar I remember the class included A* search, constraint satisfaction algorithms, decision trees, Viola-Jones detectors, MDPs, Bayes nets, HMMs, particle filters. Maybe boosting, SVMs, and n-gram models. It’s hard to remember which thing I learned from which source that far back."
@TJO_datasci Yes
Question for psychology experts of twitter: do the “bright” rats *actually perform* better because the PhD students treat them better? Or do the PhD students report higher scores to fit their advisor’s expectations? Or both? https://t.co/QLT59GCNq8
There’s a famous result in psychology where grad students report that rats are better at mazes if the advisor tells them the rats are “maze bright” rather than “maze dull”.
"@BruceTedesco More computation and data has made it possible to solve problems involving high resolution images, etc, but in 2006-2012 most deep learning researchers were working on tiny problems that are now easy to solve with the amount of computation and training data available back then."
@daniel_bilar In 2006 if you believed in neural nets then results like Geoff Hinton’s deep belief nets were reason for hope. But even those were based on the idea that supervised deep nets were hopeless and had to be propped up with unsupervised learning.
@daniel_bilar When I took my first intro to AI class in 2006 there were no neural nets in the class. At the end of the class I asked the instructor why there were no neural nets because I had expected them to be a core part of AI. He told me they turned out not to work / weren’t worth covering
@Hassle_J I owned the same personal computer / GPU throughout all of my PhD. By the time I graduated it was easy to solve problems that I believed were unlikely to be possible for purely supervised ML at the start of my PhD.
"@Hassle_J When I started grad school, the big academic debate in my area was “is supervised deep learning broken because of local minima or because of overfitting?” It turned out it was neither."
I think that barriers to the success of deep learning before 2012 were largely psychological and have previously used the 4 minute mile story as an analogy to explain it. So this surprises me.
"For years I’ve believed in the story that after the first person ran a 4 minute mile, suddenly many other athletes found that they could too, and that the 4 minute barrier was largely psychological. Today I found this article arguing that’s a myth: https://t.co/cb2z7nuluP"

@ylecun @tdietterich Large *research* community size can indicate that a field is young more than than it is influential.

3) Other papers have previously pointed out some of the same problems that Nissim et al 2019 point out.
"2) The paper I linked to, Nissim et al 2019, also says that Bolukbasi et al 2019 solve analogies using the parallelogram math like in Mikolov et al 2013a. That's not correct. Bolukbasi et al used a different algorithm that can actually choose ""queen"" without hardcoding out ""king"""
"1) It is true that in Mikolov 2013a, the word ""queen"" is chosen only if ""king"" is hardcoded out. In general, it is true that the word embeddings are not laid out so that the analogies form parallelograms."
Some updates on this: https://t.co/cUwW7tbZyM
"@seth_stafford For images, @AlecRad et al showed that linear analogies work, without an output restriction https://t.co/oCCsioEkRu"
"@WWRob @yoavgo @chrmanning Curious if @AlecRad has a take, since his DC-GAN paper showed these analogies working for images"
"@WWRob @yoavgo @chrmanning I’m not saying the paper was intended to mislead, but that the examples are famous and people draw the wrong conclusions. As primarily an image person, I didn’t realize the NLP results required hardcoded word restrictions. Similar results for image models don’t use restrictions."
"@lhenault @ylecun In Montreal many people pronounced my name as “Yann”. Also, Yann Dauphin studied there at the same time as me. Many people were thoroughly confused when Yoshua would tell stories about “Yann” trying various ML ideas “back in the ‘80s”"
"@lhenault @ylecun At NIPS 2011 there were buses for people to go see the Alhambra, divided up by last name. The G bus filled up so I was sent to the B bus, where I ended up next to Y-Lan Boureau. She speculated that maybe I was there under the pseudonym “Yann Bonhomme”"
@MihaelFeldman I’m saying analogy tasks don’t actually serve as evidence that the NLP model from the 2013 paper has captured the gender relationship between “king” and “queen”. All it knew is that “queen” is similar to “king” and a reasonable second choice if “king” is not allowed.
As far as I know these kinds of analogies actually work in image models. https://t.co/cUwW7tbZyM
Whoa! It turns out that famous examples of NLP systems succeeding and failing were very misleading. “Man is to king as woman is to queen” only works if the model is hardcoded not to be able to say “king” for the last word. https://t.co/u9kxQ3x7zL
"@roydanroy It’s especially frustrating because arxiv has consistently refused to include other features that can’t be provided on top by 3rd parties, like keeping papers anonymous during review."
"@deliprao @DrHughHarvey @IAmSamFin @OriolVinyalsML Clearly the generative model is trained differently, but it’s not obvious a priori that those differences should make it generalize dramatically better. The missing step of reasoning is to explain why the differences should cause that."
"@deliprao @DrHughHarvey @IAmSamFin @OriolVinyalsML For this paper, it’s the same amount of data, right?"
"@DrHughHarvey @IAmSamFin @deliprao @OriolVinyalsML If we pick a new, previously unseen x point, why should a generative model be a lot better at generalizing to estimate p(x|y) than a classifier is at estimating p(y|x)? I’m not saying the generative model can’t be better but the standard intuition skips this step of reasoning"
"@deliprao I personally think the point of generative models for synthetic data is mostly to transform the type of data. For example, use the generative model to meld sim and real data like in GraspGAN or sim-to-real via sim-to-sim."
@deliprao Skimming the paper a bit I feel like there’s a big “citation needed” marker on the claim that dataset augmentation of this type is a big part of the GAN research agenda. I wouldn’t be surprised if *someone* has advocated that but I’m not sure exactly who.
"@deliprao I haven’t read this particular paper, but in general if you want to reduce generalization error of a classifier by training it on generative model outputs, you’d need the generative model to generalize better/differently than the classifier for some reason."
@jm_alexia Thanks!
"I can’t find a paper I think I remember seeing. It argued that when there is enough Lipschitz regularization all GAN losses become equivalent to WGAN, and showed that this worked for an especially silly choice of loss. Anyone know what I’m thinking of?"

"@rmarcilhoo No, sparked by several people at ICLR etc asking me for advice about class imbalance and me not having enough experience to tell them anything useful. Do you have a link to Amini et al 2017? I’m not turning up anything relevant on Google Scholar"

"@yoavgo @JohnCooperAI One seed people should not forget about is Michael Gutmann’s Noise Contrastive Estimation from 2010. I worked on it during my PhD, talked with Michael at conferences, etc. GANs have the same value function but different learning dynamics."
@JohnCooperAI I think it only took about 30 seconds to put the whole GAN idea together. I had the idea during dinner/ drinks with friends and coded it up as soon as I got home. This was after spending 4 years doing a PhD on related topics and 2 years before that as a hobbyist though.
"@JohnCooperAI If you have the precise idea that works and the domain knowledge to recognize that it should work, that actually does have value. It only took about 1 hour to make the first working GAN and 2 weeks to write the paper. This was definitely a “99% inspiration, 1% perspiration” story"
@roydanroy @JohnCooperAI Do you have a link?
@gwern @JohnCooperAI It would’ve been pretty trivial to demonstrate it at least on MNIST. I was doing other generative models on MNIST as a hobbyist since about 2008. In 2014 I owned the same GPU (GTX 480) as I did in 2010. I had access to 580s but that wasn’t a gamechanger.
@aarlo @JohnCooperAI Thanks!
@JohnCooperAI That being said people do use z-less GANs for things like pix2pix and it works OK
"@JohnCooperAI They don’t seem to have the idea quite right anyway. There’s no mention of the random z vector, so this is the “pure strategy” version of the GAN game. You need z to enable “mixed strategies” for there to be a Nash equilibrium. + the post ends by saying RMSD is the right metric."

@dtweiseth Someone once sent me an email that accidentally included reply history in which some of his co-authors said that they should cite my paper but thought they could get away with not citing it
"@volkuleshov Reaching out is definitely better than public attack, and plenty of people are doing the public attack thing"
@uPicchini That sounds very nice.
"Finally, to help change the norms of the field, I encourage you not to add citations to people who publicly attack before discussing with you."
I’ve tried both strategies several times and can confidently say starting with private discussion is not only friendlier but also more effective.
"In general, discussing perceived conflicts in private yields better results than starting with a public attack, and in many cases reveals that there isn’t even a real conflict. Much less stressful and better outcomes for everyone."
"If you start by making a public complaint and then the new author adds a citation, it may not undo the harm of your public complaint. Contacting the new author in private first gives them the chance to prevent harm altogether."
"If you start by making a public complaint, some authors won’t want to add a citation because they think it will look like an admission they were wrong."
"You also lose a lot of your negotiating leverage. If the new authors don’t want to cite you, they may agree to cite you in order to avoid a public complaint. If you’ve already made the public complaint, the authors have already lost reputation."
"If you start by angering the authors of the new paper, they’re less likely to feel like citing you to be nice."
"If you go public first, you may hurt the reputation of someone who doesn’t deserve it. But you’re also less likely to get cited"
In many cases the authors will just add the citation and they honestly didn’t know your paper existed.
"If you’re upset that someone didn’t cite your paper, I strongly recommend contacting the authors privately before making a public complaint. Thread:"

"@FarzaTV The main update since back then is that a lot of people (including qualified, credible people) have tried training text GANs with methods other than back-prop. So far no one has demonstrated an advantage for text GANs over maximum likelihood"
@FarzaTV The main thing I'd revise given the chance is that before I made it sound like GANs are just not mathematically defined for text. That's too strong. A lot of the point of GANs is that you can train them only with backprop and you lose that advantage for text.

@earnmyturns @DynamicWebPaige Thanks! I actually didn't know about that.
@DynamicWebPaige I think people rarely use bagging per se with neural nets because there are enough things you can change in a neural net that you don’t need to change the training set to get different predictions. Using ensembles of neural nets or test time augmentation is similar and common

"@unsorsodicorda @OriolVinyalsML @gstsdn @smnh_azadi @catherineols We originally wrote this as an ICLR submission, before BigGAN was released. This is just an arxiv copy of the same submission.

"@rbhar90 The funny thing is, from my point of view, figuring out how to use DL as a building block was what we did from 2006-2013 or so. Since then we have already been working on new building blocks: attention, deep RL, adversarial losses, differentiable variational losses, etc."

@ctphoenix @68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel In some cases I don't like GUIs because they're hard to remote control over flaky internet connections. With ssh + vim it's easy to work remotely even while tethering over cell phone connection. That's less applicable to Mendeley though because I don't need to remote control it.
@ctphoenix @68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel Partly I don't like GUIs because I have to learn how to configure each GUI separately. I can configure my terminal / vim to work how I want once and then use them to edit text for every command line tool.
@ctphoenix @68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel Partly I don't like GUIs because I can't control them programmatically. I like to be able to write scripts that automate repetitive actions
"@ctphoenix @68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel Yeah, I don't like it very much. But I'm very picky about software tools.

@68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel Now that I work at Google it's not feasible to share a .bib with all my co-workers. I mostly don't share my .bib file with other people now. I just start each new paper by copy-pasting my .bib file from the previous paper.
@68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel The downside to this workflow is that if someone checks a bad .bib entry into the repo it breaks the .bib for everyone. But that doesn't happen too often.
"@68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel The upside to this workflow is that you rarely have to add a .bib entry because someone else will add it first. Also, other people will fix capitalization and formatting issues over time, so you should converge on good entries for the most frequently used papers."
@68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel Today I would recommend making a git repo rather than an svn repo.
"@68kirk @roydanroy @zacharylipton @colinraffel While I was a PhD student, in Yoshua's lab, everyone in the lab shared one giant ""svn"" repo called articles. This included a .bib file that everyone constantly updated."

"@ericjang11 For all my papers on feature learning for vision in grad school, I used ZCA preprocessing. I had to learn the basis vectors once on one computer and then send the basis vectors to every computer in the cluster."
"@ericjang11 ZCA is closed form (it's an eigenvalue problem). But for natural image statistics, it's so close to ill-posed that tiny differences in hardware and software can make it learn significantly different basis vectors."
"@ericjang11 Back when I actually used to use CPU for anything, it used to be important to compile my own ATLAS BLAS. And then I'd get different outcomes of machine learning experiments on the same CPU depending on how I had configured ATLAS."
"@ericjang11 Circa 2010, I worked on a DARPA-funded collaboration between UdeM and NYU. Koray and I had to get his Torch convnets and my Theano convnets to produce the same results. Even just getting the forward prop to do the same thing, with pretrained weights, took a few full days of work"
"@ericjang11 In Andrew Ng's lab circa 2008, we had some code for an autoencoder that would learn Gabor filters if run with 64 bit floats, but wouldn't learn anything meaningful if run with 32 bit floats."
@ericjang11 This definitely caused all kinds of inconsistencies without needing to do anything we'd consider large scale today.
"@ericjang11 In the bad old days when deep learning wasn't mainstream yet, I spent a lot of time in labs where sometimes I'd run my code on CPU, sometimes on one model of GPU that my lab had a few of, and sometimes on a different model of GPU that my lab had a few of."
@ericjang11 I think people who are newer to ML are somewhat insulated from this effect because today we have big clusters with several copies of the same model of GPU and because we mostly just use pre-installed TensorFlow.
@ericjang11 ML results are definitely not hardware agnostic. You should expect to need to retune hyperparameters at least a little bit whenever you change any part of the hardware / software infrastructure that changes the patterns of rounding error.

@DOmidvar There's a tiny probability that we'll figure out the brain is doing everything really inefficiently and we'll converge to small models forever. But in software it is more common for everything to get bigger forever. Look at operating system sizes over time
@DOmidvar The human brain has at least 10^14 synapses. We're overwhelmingly likely to build many ML models much larger than the brain because 1) our first version of each capability probably won't be as efficient as the brain 2) we'll want superhuman capabilities

@jeremyphoward @deliprao @srchvrs @dennybritz My main objection is that you're saying the work is neglected because it's not a PDF. This seems presumptuous to me.
"@jeremyphoward @avibryant I agree the book isn't about coding, but that seems like dodging the question of whether your course recommends it. Your course says what it's not for. Does your course say what it's for?"
@jeremyphoward @avibryant They do impact the people whose work you're discussing though.

@avibryant @jeremyphoward Formal citations really do have an impact on people's lives---not just job opportunities but also immigration opportunities. Hyperlinks don't affect those citation metrics.

"@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI Again, I don't think I've ever seen a paper get a 2/10 because the authors weren't familiar with some arcane research community etiquette. A 2/10 paper would be conspicuously inappropriate to an ML practitioner who has never published before"
@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI The pool of submissions is growing fast and the pool of experienced reviewers is not. One of the few ways the review system can cope with this situation is to focus attention on the borderline cases. Spreading attention evenly would cause accept/reject decisions to get noisier
"@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI I'm not sure how much you've participated in the review process, but it is definitely a burden these days. Conferences are swamped with low quality ML submissions. I know one AC who rejected every single paper in their stack at one recent conference."
"@marwinsegler @santoroAI Reviewers are indeed meant to update their reviews based on the rebuttals, which is sort of like a second round of reviews. But, as an area chair, it can be really hard to get some reviewers to participate in the later stages"
@santoroAI I definitely agree with this.
"@santoroAI Usually if a paper gets scored a 2, the area chair doesn't need any more info than ""this one will clearly not be accepted"" and the author doesn't need a lot of specific information about how to improve because the whole premise is probably invalid"
"@santoroAI As a frequent area chair, I don't really agree with this. It's *borderline* papers where the area chair needs the most information to decide whether it's borderline accept or borderline reject, and where the authors have the highest chance of being able to act on feedback"
"@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI Even if a reviewer wanted to mentor someone who wrote a 2 paper, it's just not feasible to provide the amount of help needed in that context. Getting an anonymous person from a 2 to even a 5 with a single, one-way message, with limited character count? That's not going to work"
"@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI A 2 paper usually isn't ""research and progress from all quarters"". Genuine progress presented in a non-academic style or using the wrong jargon, etc. would usually score higher than 2."
@iandanforth @dwf @santoroAI I'm all for inclusion but I agree with @dwf on this one. Submitting a 2 paper to a major conference is like driving 10 MPH on the freeway. It's not an effective way to learn to drive and it causes trouble for everyone else.

"@dwf @jm_alexia A lot of PIs have huge armies of students and don’t really mentor them at all. The PI just grants them access to funding and then gets academic credit for their work. This kind of gatekeeping should be broken up, and simultaneously real mentorship should be encouraged more"
"@dwf @jm_alexia I agree with that (and I think Alexia does too). I’m saying there should be a mechanism where you can get funding even if no one wants to mentor you. If you can only study topics that a member of the existing establishment is personally invested in, it’s hard to do anything new"
@JoshuaKessler1 Any specific content you want? (I do things like https://t.co/2CkX4RlhGL and talks at events etc)
@jm_alexia I agree there should be a program for junior researchers to access funding without having to go through PI gatekeepers. PI gatekeepers tend to make decisions that further the PI’s individual career rather than that are best for society
"@jm_alexia I have mixed feelings about this. In most academic disciplines we train way more PhDs than there are jobs, and then all those people struggle to find work. In AI it makes a lot of sense to train a lot of people right now, but it isn’t clear when supply will catch up to demand"
@jm_alexia The bad politics / bad environment of academia are real. I think there’s an easy way to fix this: make it easy to change academic jobs. Right now it is so hard to change jobs that universities have no incentive to work on retention
@jm_alexia I don’t quite understand the relevance of NGOs. You work at an NGO but I didn’t think your interest in AI research came from your NGO work. Do you think there needs to be better integration of NGOs or just better integration of people w/o academic/industry affiliation?

"@mat_kelcey @kasiahayden exactly.

"We rightly worry about AI enabling authoritarianism and police states. But I'm excited for us to also look at the upside:

Can we enable more understanding, flexible, humane governments that don't try to fit the world in simple boxes?"
"But neural networks are able to learn representations of fuzzy things.

""What is a dog?"" is actually a very fuzzy, wiggly concept.

And so neural networks take all these things that previously couldn't be systematized, and being to make them computationally accessible."
"""Nature is wiggly, everything wiggles, the outlines of the hills, the shapes of the tress ... And we say, “well let’s get things straightened out, let’s get this ironed out, let’s get it all squared away. ... all this wiggliness is too complicated."" - Alan Watts"
Programmers see this kind of issue all the time. Handling all the edge cases is _hard_. And the real world is full of edge cases.
"It strikes me this isn't unique to States. It's an issue of automation and working at scale.

A mundane example I was reading about today: Google making assumptions about names that harm outliers."
"Scott's _Seeing Like a State_ describes States as needing to make the world legible to their bureaucracies. In order to do this, they use simplified models of the world and then often force it on their subjects.

This causes grave harms and also just missed opportunities."
"States force the world into simplistic models to make it legible to bureaucracy, sometimes at the cost of great harm. (see James Scott)

Software often forces even more simple and rigid schemas.

But deep learning makes fuzzy human ideas computable. Can it reverse the trend?"

"@killroy42 That's certainly a thing people do! Unfortunately, I'm not sure that we understand how training against, say, gaussian noise generalizes to other kinds of robustness very well yet."
"This suggests an alternative interpretation: Perhaps the adversarial directions just strongly correlated in parameter space with a true useful feature. When you fit to them, you get the useful feature, and vice versa."
Clearly the adversarial directions aren't a linear feature. The model is interpolating some more complicated feature from each adversarial direction.

"@jh_jacobsen Also, just at a practical level, adversarial training is expensive and tricky to really implement correctly."
"@jh_jacobsen Online vs offline is one big difference. But I think there's actually a deeper one:

Adversarial training creates counterexamples, penalizing the model for sensitivity. In contrast, this is trying to create a dataset where those features were never present in the first place."
"This does seem like non-trivial evidence for adversarial examples being genuine features of the data, rather than properties of our models or training set quirks.

Caveat to all of this: Adversarial examples are not my domain of expertise and I haven't read this super carefully!"
"(3) The other interesting result is that you can create a different dataset of adversarial attacks, where you try to predict the attack class.

They find this model - trained on adversarial attacks - generalizes to clean data, which I probably wouldn’t have predicted in advance. https://t.co/ood8JL1dVy"
"I say claim because I’ve learned to not believe any robustness claim until people like Nicholas Carlini have taken a shot at breaking it!

Note that this isn’t a robustness free lunch -- you still need to create the original robust model through adversarial training."
"(2) The claim which will seems to me really remarkable if it holds up is that you can use this process to turn robust models into robust datasets, for which normal training creates robust models. https://t.co/WwC4okBahs"
"They’re basically using this to try and filter the dataset through the model’s features. It almost feels a bit like model distillation, but to a dataset.

(The method is vaguely similar in technique to Gerhos et al’s “Stylized ImageNet”, but feels pretty different.)"

@catherineols @neuroecology It also reveals that there's a huge amount of variance in what neural networks end up learning! That's something we'd like to understand better at some point.
"@catherineols @neuroecology So we mostly use (2) -- often just called ""feature visualization"" -- and it can shed a lot of insight on higher layers of networks: https://t.co/bLQMQLYz9c"
"@catherineols @neuroecology You might ask ""approach (1) seems more informative -- why not just use it?"" Well, unfortunately (1) only really works for the first hidden layer, where the relationship is linear. On the other hand, (2) works at any layer."
"@catherineols @neuroecology The difference you see is because there are two different ways to visualize the same thing:

(1) Visualizing the weights
(2) Creating optimal stimuli

Conv nets very consistently learn edge &amp; color contrast detectors in the first layer. They're just being presented differently."

This is part of what I was exploring in https://t.co/Ncd2qbCMn5 https://t.co/PoyEhrgdtj"
@joe_hellerstein @arvindsatya1 @distillpub 6/ I think the same techniques for pulling the abstractions back to the input (ie. creating exemplars as in feature vis) will still be essential. It's just that now we have to do something like AIA to build up abstractions.
"@joe_hellerstein @arvindsatya1 @distillpub 5/ I'd see your concern about ""input data is not close to human semantics"" as being about domains where we don't have sophisticated abstractions / dedicated sensory system for understanding the data. So, we have less scaffolding to understand the model's abstractions."
"@joe_hellerstein @arvindsatya1 @distillpub 4/ WRT ""illegible data"" I speculate:
- Powerful models need to create abstractions
- To understand them, we need to understand the abstractions
- If we lack relevant abstractions, we need to invest cultivating them (ie. AIA)
- Feature vis helps by making examplars of abstractions"

"@arvindsatya1 @joe_hellerstein @distillpub 4/ If the distance between you and an abstraction is really far, you may first need to internalize the more basic abstractions of a model. This starts to become something like the artificial intelligence augmentation article.

"@arvindsatya1 @joe_hellerstein @distillpub 2/ Of course, the more alien the abstraction, or the less we understand the input data, the harder it's going to be to understand the abstraction. This is a pretty fundamental challenge."
"@arvindsatya1 @joe_hellerstein @distillpub To add a bit more: neural network features are abstractions over the input data. If we want to understand them, we need to pull them back to the input. Feature vis is more or less exploring how to do this ""pullback"" by creating exemplar inputs of the abstraction."

@sjuneja90 @AndrewKemendo @catherineols See the other thread 🙂
"@AndrewKemendo @catherineols But the good news is that practically speaking, unless you're in one of those edge cases, the claim at the top of this thread is true.

I.e. We don't need to prove that a measure of meaning is always accurate, merely be confident it is in our current situation."
@AndrewKemendo @catherineols Surely if you saved my life I would think it matters. You as well!
@AndrewKemendo @catherineols Saving one human life is not granular or well defined?
"@AndrewKemendo @catherineols People objectively measure what matters all the time! And I'm not even sure it has to be objective.

For example, most would agree objectively that saving a human life matters."

@clarelyle @yaringal .@openminedorg 🙂
@davidpfahler It's hard to feel satisfied looking out the window to an office park with the knowledge you could be literally anywhere right now.
@skoularidou @XLdean Easiest way to start is Calvert school. They literally give you the day by day breakdown of what to teach/read/assign each day.
@skoularidou @XLdean Sure thing! Let me now if you go for it. DMs open for Qs as well.
@aweisen123 @NickFisherAU I grew up in Memphis TN in the 90s (a railroad/industrial revolution town when manufacturing went overseas.) A far cry from SF 🙂
"@aweisen123 @NickFisherAU Honestly I knew plenty of relatively unwealthy/modestly educated homeschooling families who absolutely rocked it. Most of them were below average income because one of the parents chose to educate instead. It's hard to beat a personal tutor who deeply loves you, even with no PhD."
"@skoularidou @XLdean Yeah. My 4.0 gpa didn't carry as much weight and we knew it wouldn't. You have to lean more on standardised testing. 

But my twin and I are both finishing up PhDs now (me in the UK) and it's not held us back."
"@NickFisherAU But the northeast, CA, and Colorado have pretty big communities as well"
@NickFisherAU Yeah. USA south in particular in which HS is very popular
"@davidpfahler Really really REALLY hoping to. 

Also one possible negative side effect of homeschooling is that I absolutely hate working in a cube in an office. I just never got used to sitting in a row of minions to ""the man"". Lol. 

We homeschooled on a sailboat in the Caribbean for 2 years"
"@NickFisherAU Also worth mentioning our local co-ops had sports teams (national champs!), prom, yearbooks, chess/debate clubs, and lots of other stuff you need large groups for."
"@skoularidou @XLdean We did it so that if ever I was applying for a job/uni which didn't like homeschooling I was covered. 

But in the long run I never used it. My uni and jobs all loved it and had great experience with prior HS folks"
@skoularidou Yup - but in your case I'd expect it would go quite well. 🙂
"@XLdean @skoularidou I don't know. It's quite legal in the USA. Might have to move.

Although in high school I was registered in a local private school which had an  ""off campus program"" 😜which gave us accreditation. So maybe that could work. In the eyes of the state I was private schooled."
"@NickFisherAU Yup! Also we carpooled like crazy.

Also in late high school most of my friends and I took classes at the local college - homeschool version of AP. I knew people who started undergrad with 36+ hours under their belt."
"@skoularidou In general I'd say it's just a wider standard deviation. Public school does a lot of harm socially as well (bullying, etc). These kinds of things don't really happen in tight knit communities of families homeschooling. The parents are way too involved."
"@skoularidou I did come across plenty of homeschooling done to shelter kids for perhaps irrational reasons.

But also worth mentioning most of the top students in every category we're also homeschooled because you get a total unfair advantage with respect to amount of free time."
"@DataChaz It's hard if both parents work full time at jobs which aren't remote/WFH friendly. 

But if you're paying for private school in this situation I'd argue the DIY version might be better value for your time than the extra income going to tuition."
@NickFisherAU It's basically a scenario where each family has a parent which teaches a class in their strongest subject. All the parents/teachers know each other and have mutual interest in helping to raise/teach. (Note this was in an urban/suburban area with population density)
"@NickFisherAU My mom worked from home, although it's also worth mentioning that in upper grades local co-ops of parents teaching each other's kids helps it scale really well."
"Huge 👍 to this thread. 

I was homeschooled. 

At first it was so my family could travel, then it was so that I could spend 30+ hours a week on extracurricular personal pursuits (sports, music, &amp; tech). Big adv.

I'll definitely homeschool my kids and teach them coding at age ~8 https://t.co/VzlcQjEspd"

"@fchollet To be fair I'm being fast and loose with more data, better data, and task information. In my book, GAN is more training data, better regularizers are learning bias (with a hint of more training data), and even optimizers are mostly about good bias."
"@BenLaurie Haha yeah I totally had that too - note that as a result my face is like 2 inches from the welder. lol

What could go wrong?!?!"
@fchollet Given the no free lunch theorem - isn't it fair to say that these are the only ways forward?
"Last night a good friend of mine taught me how to weld!!! Was quite fun - got a little sunburned but highly recommend trying it (just cover up your skin)

"@ErikJonker @mattdlockyer ""Onwership"" is simply a bundle of rights. 

It's easier to bundle together rights for physical items. 

With time, we will see more fine-grained transfer of rights, and made easier. Eg by tokenizing each right. Not unlike traditional fiat."
"@ErikJonker @mattdlockyer There is no law of nature that constrains ownership to physical goods.

"@joel_john95 Interesting thoughts, thanks.

Data is IP. The value of a piece of IP can change over time, depending on usage, perceived value, etc. The Beatles IP is gonna stay valuable for a while. But yesterday's weather,less so."
"@joel_john95 Great Q. Even though ultimately we want to serve consumers, in practice it seems that biz &amp; govt use cases are more practical to start.

"@C1aranMurray @mrauchs @prestonjbyrne Governance on a private chain within a single enterprise is gonna be much simpler than a public chain, sure. Extend up from sysadmin keys, or down from c-levels.

"@joel_john95 Everyone has exposure to the data economy. Billions through FB alone. Alas this is an opaque, closed data economy. We need to make that economy open and permissionless, to equalize opportunity and spread benefits from the gains of data &amp; AI. Not niche at all; it's everyone."
"@joel_john95 Re surveillance capitalism: that's happening, because FB etc have arbitraged the difference bw consumer perception of the value of data, vs FB's knowledge of it. Consumers get the raw deal.Putting financial instruments around data can let consumers reassert control and related $."
@joel_john95 Re data as NFTs: it seems logical to me. What would be the counter-argument?

-assume that data assets are assets in the financial sense. Wrap nft around a data DID. If you like, make re-fungible on top of nft.
-then ask: what does it look like when we apply DeFi building blocks to these data assets?"
"@mayazi Agreed. Yet any system that tries to equalize outcome will have problems incentivizing its people. USSR and China both tried, and had issues. China changed, and things improved.

Better: equalize opportunity, not outcome. This incl. a social safety net. Soften extreme outcome,ok."
"@nembal @mayazi If Canadian version, then look for communities that 
-ask ""how can we better collaborate, to benefit all?"" and 
-aim for equal opportunity

"@foxnbots @spengrah @mwilcox @AdamPaigge @simondlr Re liabilities concern: that's a good one too. I think that could be clearly delineated from the beginning, though. Gun mfrs to not have liabilities on people killed by their guns. (This is not a defense of guns per se, just an example of directing of liability.)"
"@foxnbots @spengrah @mwilcox @AdamPaigge @simondlr This is a concern I have too, actually. Why give bot surplus to usi if you can keep it as profit? One solution is govt regulations by govts that want usi. Is there a cleaner way?"
"@spengrah @foxnbots @AdamPaigge @mwilcox @simondlr I agree. I actually say ""KPI"" to make it easier for a general audience. Or at least a biz audience (!)

But ""objective"" is more technically accurate, for sure. Even better, ""objective function"":)"
"@foxnbots @AdamPaigge @mwilcox @spengrah @simondlr Yes, exactly, that's the Q! Note that we've reduced the problem into figuring out funding: it an engineering / business problem. My favorite answer is: redirect the surplus generated by self-owning AIs into a USI chain.

"@_anirban_ @stewartbrand That's a complementary way to view it, yep! Eg using ""unvalued"" data in cell towers for weather prediction. Then you can actually predict weather way better in places where there are no other sensors. In turn, it improves global weather prediction."
"@alaeven @wslyvh @Clogish @JacobBoers @oceanprotocol @bsuichies @myhealthmydata Exactly. Ocean enables this architecture.

A use case I dream of: a model across 1B humans to predict medical issues (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer xyz); where no single entity owns or controls the infrastructure or the final model; and no data honeypot across the 1B."
@neilasmyth Ditto! My email is at https://t.co/jgg30IWPeh.
"@_anirban_ @stewartbrand It's solvable because it's different parties that want ""free"" versus ""get paid""."
@wslyvh @alaeven @Clogish @JacobBoers @oceanprotocol @bsuichies @myhealthmydata The use case has to be compelling enough to make it worth overcoming the data transactional friction. We see that Ocean's adoption will be one good use case at a time.
"""Information wants to be free; it also wants to be expensive"" is from the amazing @stewartbrand. 

What excites me: Ocean provides a new solution. Here's how:
-Make the data free for consumers, and 
-Compensate creators / referrers / suppliers using network rewards. https://t.co/G4hh6vVAfr"
"@foxnbots @AdamPaigge @mwilcox @spengrah @simondlr For me, the goal is not to measure what level they're at. It's to give them income to get not only the basic needs, but enough to chase their dreams (if they choose). No measure needed. Just income. The kpi can be considered an implicit goal."

@mckmuze @TCRPartyVIP Thanks for the tip!
"@spengrah @simondlr @mwilcox To me, the kpi for humanity is % humans that have the opportunity to self actualize (top of Maslow's hierarchy). Along the way, incentivize to move humans towards the top.

The definition of self actualize is different for every human. 

Opportunity is not outcome, of course."
"@wslyvh @Clogish @JacobBoers @alaeven @oceanprotocol A complementary answer. I see that Ocean will succeed one ai use case at a time. Autonomous driving accuracy. Medical modeling accuracy. Provenance if data in the enterprise. At first it will be a trickle of use cases, then a stream, then a river."
"@wslyvh @Clogish @JacobBoers @alaeven @oceanprotocol Here's how. They have data, want to see if it has value, but are scared of it escaping. And they have limited access to ai talent. The answer : they sell access to the data, bring the ai modeling to the data, on premises. With a decentralized substrate (Ocean) to orchestrate it."

"Current Five stats: 3205-21 (99.3% winrate). Only three teams have achieved a 2+ game win streak.

Interestingly we are running more cooperative games at any given time than competitive ones!

https://t.co/aWAmfnpYqe"
OpenAI Five has achieved meme status. All our dreams have finally come true. https://t.co/TvChaszb3l
"#1, #2, and #3 on /r/MachineLearning are about OpenAI results — don't think I've seen that before. Pretty cool to see the team's efforts percolating through the community! (First two are others' applications of GPT-2; third is Dota.) https://t.co/f4lYnyEjZ9"
@kasperfredn Yep just a bug on our end with how people join the game.

"@andreisavu Learning from human amounts of data would be a big breakthrough. Hard to say what that breakthrough would require since no one's done it.

If we just wanted to make Five stronger though, there's an incremental path: https://t.co/gf2Z6VnhUN"
@NicoChauvin74 @wnevets Yep that one is definitely a bug... team waking up now.
@wnevets So far only seen outplays. Though looks like we need to investigate the 2-win streak: https://t.co/P66HlU5XsK
"After 2000 games, the first 2-win steak by humans! Five’s win record is 99.5%.

(Incidentlalt, it had a 99.9% win rate versus the Five version that played at The International — puts that number into perspective!) https://t.co/LNesKCkaDI"
"“The bots are locked,” the player said, as transcribed on Reddit. “They are not learning, but we humans are. We will win.” 

One of the reasons that an AI system which can learn from human amounts of data (vs 45k years of experience) will be a big deal!

https://t.co/u1OAnYejBM"
@karoly_zsolnai Something seems off — leaderboard only shows one player. Team will check it out when awake.
@WagaGaming @OpenAI Congrats and good luck!
"6 human wins so far, out of 1288 games. No one’s yet beaten Five twice in a row!

Over 1000 concurrent games running, with more than 2,500 concurrent human players. Pretty cool to see Five scale to play all those games at once. https://t.co/efx4LPDOdE"
Looks like the first victory was by a Thai pro team! Read more here: https://t.co/myGtVOAkM7
"First human victory!! Brings Five’s winrate to 99.8%. Great work to the players, whose accomplishment will be immortalized on the Arena leaderboard. https://t.co/VbFucSFzY4"
OpenAI Five wins the first 500 games versus humans. But a few groups are systematically searching for every weakness — and making real progress. There is hope yet that Five can be beaten! https://t.co/507HhKZuqJ
@sarafianosn @KelseyTuoc Yep display bug.
@sarafianosn @KelseyTuoc Sadly I think that's a display bug — team working on it :). Will confirm either way.
@KelseyTuoc So far people have just beaten the database :)! Just getting started though — plenty of time for human ingenuity to do its thing.

"@robinc @paul_scharre @tdietterich @Miles_Brundage @jackclarkSF @OpenAI The learning system is fully general-purpose — that's what powers this: https://t.co/PQGhabYIR1.

Network is basically a bunch of Dota-specific (but straightforward) embeddings, etc to get the game state to run through an LSTM.

The training Data is totally Dota-specific."
@tdietterich So if I created a company 10 months ago it’d be “gratuitous and misleading” to call it “10 months old”?

"Ok so not *everything* at the event was smooth. My apologies :)!

On the plus side, resulted in a pretty funny Reddit post — worth watching the clip until you figure out what's going on. Top post of /r/Dota2 yesterday! https://t.co/bqBcilgwtG"
"@robinc @OpenAI We now have an answer for how to solve even massively hard problems given a good enough simulator and enough compute. Before (see reactions after our losses at TI) there was doubt about how far these methods would go.

Next step is figuring out how to solve from less data."
"@nickfrosst Just ongoing development — e.g. we'd already created 1v1 code that could control a courier, and we just so we started with 5 copies to control 5 couriers."
"We trained a single AI for the past 10 months, something we haven't seen before in reinforcement learning.

OpenAI Five at The International was 1.5 months old.

OpenAI Five at Finals was 10 months old.

*Huge* difference in performance. And the curves still haven't leveled off. https://t.co/UUTWE7CsqQ"
"Been a crazy journey! 2 years ago, we started working on Dota because it felt totally impossible for existing AI methods — we wanted to invent a new algorithm. But we kept scaling up existing methods to test their limits — and we still haven't hit a wall!

My opening remarks from OpenAI Five Finals on Saturday: https://t.co/BmOzehOhDG
"@sherjilozair @OpenAI @OGesports .@Blitz_DotA and others had figured out the 18 hero meta as of Benchmark. It's certainly different from the full meta, but not really hard for pros to figure out.

It's actually much less fair to force the *bots* to play according to the human meta!"
"""From our human perspective, @ODPixel, this is an even game. How are they saying 95%?!?!"" — @DotACapitalist at 1hr 34min 40s, as OpenAI Five predicts it has a 95% chance of winning the game.

https://t.co/dZQkjDDVi6"
"Seriously amazing work! Event yesterday was primarily put together by @nadipity and @jonasschneider, with big contributions from Loren Kwan, @apilipis, the rest of the OpenAI Dota team, and others from around the company. Get some well-deserved rest :). https://t.co/25dK4psiEW"
@davegershgorn Love this thread :)
@zajasu 2-0 for each.
"@aravind7694 That’s a fair point, meant to be more evocative than a rigorous claim. We also don’t have evidence that Five can’t adapt!"
"I usually like to refer to Five as analogous to an insect — trained on an evolutionary timescale, operates via ingrained “instincts” which handle even unexpected things in its environment, but can’t quickly adapt to pick up new skills.

Feels like a step forward but much remains. https://t.co/bK2Jjk42eA"
Interesting thread on some things humans can learn from Five: https://t.co/XgtiTRjGA2
"Good guess :)!

https://t.co/s9vWhpB3kb"
Very curious to see this too :). https://t.co/uEBQ99vQzP

"It's inspiring to see how excited /r/Dota2 gets about our progress. It's really motivating to have a supportive and enthusiastic community to cheer you on. While the OpenAI Five journey is ending, I hope we'll have other interesting Dota-based projects to share in the future!! https://t.co/0akmuMF3Yo"

"Thanks!!

We agree the massive training data requirement is a real limitation — fixing that issue is a next focus.

On the other hand, we are able to use this same technology to go surprisingly far in the real world, such as our robotic hand project.

"Special announcement: we’re inviting the entire Internet to play OpenAI Five (whether as a competitor or teammate) at once.

Sign up today! Very excited to see what we learn from observing OpenAI Five in the wild. https://t.co/TaMhxdgVIt"
"Part 3 of the event... OpenAI for everyone.

@cbd says the nice thing about modern AI is that, once trained, it can scale it up massively."
.@SheeverGaming on cooperative mode — “It felt nice. Viper gave its life for me! It believed in me (even if it shouldn’t).”
"Have one last (quick!) announcement coming shortly. #OpenAIFive

https://t.co/5ctJNOOCKw"
And @Blitz_DotA @SheeverGaming win the cooperative match! Awesome to see the first public match of “OpenAI + humans”!
"Net worth back to about even, 56 mins in. Wow."
Dire bots estimate a 1% win probability. Humans blame them for giving up :)
"@DotACapitalist makes a mistake while defending base and gets killed, but his teammates save the day and defend."
"Game has gone back and forth so far. Radiant was pushing into dire’s base; then dire into radiant’s. 50 min so far, 3k net with to Radiant."
"Bot buys a moonshard for @DotACapitalist, in an altruistic move donating some of its net worth towards a teammate."
@Blitz_DotA tries using the chat command for controlling his bot ally’s lane — but it only works for early game. Bot replies to him saying he is too late; laning phase is over.
Dire taking Roshan — @DotACapitalist and several bots together.
@Blitz_DotA does an OpenAI Five-style buyback :)!
"Now starting to see bots and humans teaming up to push. Took longer than in the bot vs human games, but happening!!"
"Bots and humans are consistently teaming up to attack an enemy — but it’s rarer to see bots coming in to defend.

Worth keeping in mind that Five thinks each player is as good as it is — so perhaps it believes that whoever’s being attacked can handle themselves."
"The action of the game seems to focus on the humans, which is cool. Lets the humans determine the tempo and flow of the game."
"@OG_BDN0tail says for human games generally, it’s better to fail doing the same thing than succeed by doing different things — sometimes hard to do in pub games!"
@OG_BDN0tail jokes that the bot who was just killled and bought back is tilted.
"Two Dire bots are chasing @Blitz_DotA, and two of his teammates come to defend."
Thank you! https://t.co/d4SoBnquMF
@ODPixel and a bot team up to kill @Blitz_DotA. Well played!
"10 mins in, 3-6 kills in favor of Dire. Net worth pretty even."
"@Blitz_DotA gets two bots very low on health but dies before killing them.

Much chiller game than the OG ones, played at much more human speed."
@Blitz_DotA “I think we’re supposed to go top now @SheeverGaming”
@Blitz_DotA teaming up with two bots to take mid tier 1 tower.
"Humans fail to call out that mid OpenAI Five player is missing, and so it gets a successful kill on @SheeverGaming"
First blood drawn by @SheeverGaming and a bot teaming up against @DotACapitalist!
"And the first cooperative match begins — no longer AI vs Humans, now AI + Humans!!"
Drafting in progress! https://t.co/uPI6va2IUR
@OG_BDN0tail says his team is split on whether the AI can possibly make the correct calculation for the buyback strategy — need to be able to predict so much of what’s gonna happen in the game.
"@OG_BDN0tail says that Five is very good at deciding when to give up on a fight/objective. Not sure how but they do it well. Use the spells and combos very well.

Says there’s lots for humans to learn from Five."
"@OG_BDN0tail says that he thinks with 10 games, they’d be able to win; with 50 games, win consistently. Would be super interesting to see..."
Coop players now on stage. https://t.co/9AgLk4yrUh

@OGesports @OpenAI We were all so honored by the chance to play with you. Really amazing to see such an amazing team testing what we’ve built!!!
"As promised, this event isn’t just about competition — OpenAI Five can also operate as a teammate to humans! Going to do demo that capability now."
So excited to show the progress made since last public showmatch.
"Game 2 was surreal — was about 20-25 mins, and was on OpenAI Five’s side the entire way through. The tempo set by Five was extremely fast."
"But wait there’s more.... still have some surprises to show. #OpenAIFive

https://t.co/ZKKXFgkafX"
"OpenAI Five makes history by winning a best-of-three versus @OGesports, the Dota 2 world champions!!!! Huge congrats to the team and to OG for an extremely well-played match."
"Humans chase an almost dead Crystal Maiden, who uses her shadow amulet in a way that people don’t. Chasers ends up falling to a pincer of bots."
"“It’s just crazy” say the casters. Five is up 12k net worth, 21-5 kills. On the high ground, taking a rax at 15 mins."
Teamfight kills two humans. Human buys back. Casters say he’s “trying OpenAI tactics”
"13 mins. 15-5, 6k net worth to Five."
"Five is playing “at a ferocious speed”. Up 2 towers, 13-4 kills, 5k gold."
"10 mins in, 11-3 with 4K net worth to Five."
"Currently 9-3 in favor of Five, 2k gold.

Ceb does a great fog-of-war play where he keeps dodging a gyro looking to finish him off.

Five does an amazing play having a Sven navigate out with almost zero health."
Casters say that Five plays Viper unlike humans do.
"5-3 in favor of bots, “gyro + CM combo is so strong” say the casters."
"3-3 kills, even net worth, at about 3 min 30 seconds."
"Five declares on private chat some of its strategy — who will buy wards, play support, etc."
First blood to Five! Got just enough poison damage to kill Topson on the last tick.
"Casters talking about the OG draft, eg heroes to defend towers or push."
Casters talking about what to expect for game 2. eg humans using fissure from earthshaker to control the bottom wave.
Humans chat they estimate their win probability at 7 — mimicking Five :)
Caught the tail end of the game 2 banner :) https://t.co/NKjQMpGRWe
Draft is finalized! Game 2 will begin shortly. I am excited but nervous — the humans have learned from game 1; the bots have not!! https://t.co/QC0f2Hltew
Drafting for game 2 begins. https://t.co/6wzV1HlFmO
We also announced that we’d won the first game vs our other pro/semi-pro test teams.
@OGesports back at their computers for game 2. https://t.co/rySfYQFq1t
"Starting a new thread for Game 2. #OpenAIFive

https://t.co/eH2WblCkdR"
“In eight years of Dota I’ve never seen this.”
"Person next to me comments on two aspects of Five:

- Early game buybacks. Not something pros usually do, but it is a good insight: you get the money back by farming.
- Dynamic role switching. Also not something that pros do — usually they pool on one hero chosen at beginning."
"Wow, that was an intense game. So proud of the team. No matter what happens game 2 (and possibly 3) this is an amazing accomplishment!!!"
OpenAI Five wins game 1 versus @OGesports!!!!! First AI to ever defeat a professional esports team on a public livestream.
"Another teamfight. Human lose four heroes, bots lose only Crystal Maiden."
"All heroes are alive. Bots up 14k gold, 41-27 kills."
"Casters talk about how Five knew that Viper couldn’t be in a location for a certain period of time, so it was worth pursuing a certain fight."
"Another bot push, humans manage to defend. Game not over yet! Death prophet is down with no buyback, humans may make a comeback."
Casters day Dota is too complicated to have a perfect game. Have seen some beautiful plays.
"Team fight, humans lose 3 heroes, Five loses one."
"32-24, bots up by 10k"
Humans trying to set a trap by hiding in the trees...
"Casters saying that Five knew humans were taking Roshan, but decided it was more important to take map objectives."
Humans just took Roshan.
Now 31-23. Five up by 10k gold. Here’s a viz of what Five is thinking. https://t.co/sj64jczPaN
"OG is teamwiped. Five is up by 8k, all heroes alive."
Casters now talking about “the power of early game buybacks”.
Humans do an amazing play and save their Riki.
"Bots up 7k gold, at 24-20 kills."
Big team fight. Human team loses 5 heroes. Bots lose no one.
"We see this happen in test games all the time: the bots buy back, the humans laugh, and then the humans lose. Hard to know if it’ll happen here too..."
Bots do something humans don’t do: gyro is killed and immediately buys back even though the base isn’t under attack.
Humans closing the gap — now 15-16 and bots up by 1k net worth.
Fun play where bot sniper and human riki kill each other exactly.
"Teamfight where crystal maiden hit almost zero health. Bots turn around the teamfight, now 12-11 and bots up 3k"
"10 mins in, 8-9 kills in favor of humans, bots up by 1k net worth!"
"Casters say that humans keep cutting the creep wave, but Five is responding appropriately."
Still even — 7-7. Neck and neck!
"Humans try to spring a trap; five reverses it and evens up the game at 6-6, even net worth"
"Humans get two kills, 3-5 in favor of humans, up by 1k net worth."
"Even trade slightly favoring OG, now 2-2. Casters speculating on OG’s strategy."
"Humans kill crystal maiden. 1-1 kills, gold about even."

@Sam_L_Shead Nope — that was donation to OpenAI Nonprofit.
"Agree with Miles — one of the best parts of OpenAI is working with people who care so deeply about the mission.

https://t.co/3NnBzj0LTT"
"@gwern @davidiach @OpenAI Per our Charter (https://t.co/vmDqjnneTa) our primary means of accomplishing the mission is to build safe AGI directly. As you say it's going to take a lot of compute!

(Interestingly, our safety research looks similar in profile to other ML research and is also scaling fast.)"
@jeffrschneider @OpenAI All transactions between the Nonprofit and the LP were approved by a subset of the Board — only directors without a financial interest in the LP. We had the fair market value of anything transferred from the nonprofit to the LP determined by an outside firm.
"@gwern @OpenAI We will need to raise billions of dollars. If we do not, the Nonprofit would fail at its mission.

We then needed a structure that let us custom-write (very unusual!) rules like the following:

- Fiduciary duty to the charter
- Cap returns
- Full control to OpenAI Nonprofit"
"Thanks Catherine!

@gwern Yep!
"Another remarkable finding is this model learns to do a non-trivial job (and in rare case, set new state-of-the-art) on NLP tasks it wasn't directly trained on.

"@kashandra92 @karpathy There appear to be open challenges too. One is explanatory knowledge (eg reasoning to generate new knowledge to explain things like no object travels faster than light.), but this is less concrete still."
"@kashandra92 It’s hard to predict the future when we can’t even grasp what is going on now. We certainly need to do more of the above recipe in other domains, improve dataset construction (see eg @karpathy), have a clear objective, etc."
@robertskmiles @jackclarkSF AlphaZero is no exception. Selfplay is a narrow but effective way of generating massive datasets of experience automatically.
"Last decade in AI was about solving big associative learning: Language models, image labelling, speech recognition, lipreading, Starcraft, etc. A triumph! The recipe was always the same: 1. Big net 2. Massive curated dataset 3. Many iterations. Building the dataset is underrated."

"I should explain. I’m a proud African with over 20 years of AI research. At all the major AI conferences where as a speaker I have asked for Africans to raise their hands, there were zero! This started to change two years ago thanks to efforts like eg @DeepIndaba &amp; @black_in_ai"

"@soumithchintala There have been excellent efforts on releasing powerful RL agents — see https://t.co/fseogEiVCr more importantly, releasing components for others to innovate their own agents is important. Pytorch is more valuable than code for a specific net in some paper, right? 😊"

"@egrefen Of course you do Ed 😊 Big innovations are typically robust (resnets, attention, ADAM, etc). Moreover, if people don’t try to reimplement from scratch, they might no get the understanding needed for innovation. I am a fan of release, my point is about doing it the right way."

"Damn, some days being an academic is so interesting. This is such a clear overview describing the stakes of inducing hierarchy in language and the recent intellectual history of this challenge. https://t.co/d1entpvGan"
"@nsaphra @ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick Ah, this is quite an interesting point. One reading of this argument is that, in addition to our parameterization, we are really benefiting from SGD/Adam as the regularizer here. Or more so that embeddings + SGD work well in combination."
Code here: https://t.co/uugVacPEDh
"@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick We did not try EM by ""coordinate descent with alternating global GD on parameters and DP for marginals"". It's really slow to implement in toolkits, and the win seems minor. SGD over DP has the same objective and feels like a fair, batched modern incarnation of that technique."
@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick We had long conversations about the history of eval metrics for this task. Binary branching constituency trees was the only one Yoon was convinced about (there is a *lot* of footnoted discussion in the paper).
@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick https://t.co/uugVacPEDh
"@ryandcotterell @BergKirkpatrick Yeah, that paper stuck with me as well. The story of parameterization/features in unsupervised learning is still confusing to me."
"@ryandcotterell Right. The unintuitive part is how well a vanilla log marginal-likelihood (not conditional?, although that might be terminology). This is roughly an embedding version of @BergKirkpatrick's ""Painless Unsupervised Learning with Features"" paper https://t.co/aM2I3DSKII."

@boknilev @gneubig That's a really good idea. Here's are some that were called out by ACs:
"@PSalajka @tradewindturb @harvardnlp Yeah, that's right. We reinitialize everything, so it is okay, but some of the pytorch folks suggested not doing this."
"What's interesting is that the *model* is not deep. But the *inference* really is. This is not a new point, but it was somewhat surprising to me given the history of this problem."
These compound/bayesian models perform much better and push the state-of-the-art on some on these parsing tasks. You can even see how the latent state causes the same treelet structure to cover different lexical realizations. https://t.co/jU3CBxyvFb
"The next experiment considers latent-variable CFGs, e.g Berkeley parser, that create richer grammars that learn broader dependencies. Modern systems can incorporate lv with amortized VI / VAE. These approaches play nicely and you can collapse even tree-inference while sampling. https://t.co/PTbDWVSqzG"
"The first experiment in this work revisits this question. It replicates the common wisdom that ""MLE for PCFGs"" is broken, but finds that even simple param factorization, ""EM for neural CFGs"" (embed non-terminals) works pretty well by itself, when trained with backprop. https://t.co/bUjMKd86vD"
"This problem sparked a whole research direction of methods that ""adjusted"" the unsupervised objective through priors, regularization, features, and objective ""modifications""... I love these papers, but they rest on this core assumption that ""MLE for PCFGs is bad""."
"During this period conventional wisdom in the field was that, while a really nice pedagogical exercise, EM did not work for this problem. The trees were just not good, and presumably the MLE solution for PCFGs was just bad (although it is provably intractable to check)."
"In the mid 2000s, there was significant interest in NLP in unsupervised parsing, e.g. how to induce a tree representation from text. Many approaches used some variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) to induce a context free grammar (PCFG), as taught in an intro ML class."

@gwenckatz @MITIBMLab We're in a weird research state where it is currently much easier to generate fake text than it is to make that type of simple real-world inference.
"@falcondai @gwern @MITIBMLab Yup, and I am in agreement with you. This former problem is definitely the more interesting one as well. I'm sure people have thought about its sample complexity, but I'm worried (as you say) that it is quite difficult."
@OverlordLork @JanelleCShane Yeah... unfortunately if the model is not good enough or the text is too common it will definitely fail. The approach only really works for novel text that looks close to human-level.
"@spott_andrew @S_Gehrmann Interestingly, the way to pass this test is to replicate the true LM* of language, i.e. what learned LM are trained to do anyway. Although you are certainly right that other sampling schemes could fool it. Would love to see more sophisticated detectors through."
"@falcondai @gwern @MITIBMLab Btw, great to hear from you! Been too long."
"@falcondai @gwern @MITIBMLab Sure, I think I am in agreement? We are not claiming we can detect distributional difference, but sampling differences. If you really get close to LM*, and take unbiased samples from that distribution, this task becomes impossible (in the unconditional case)."
"@gwern @MITIBMLab Good point. We think its mostly the latter. If you have access to the exact same model, you could detect both sources of failures. Our claim though is just that with a good enough model, you can easily spot top-k/high-temp sampling that produces the hyperreal samples"
"@ShekharLeena @S_Gehrmann Huh, yeah this looks borderline. How did you generate?"
@S_Gehrmann @jctestud @henddkn @MITIBMLab oh where does it go to?
@MasterScrat @S_Gehrmann We think if systems tried to do that then the generated text would (perhaps) have more human-recognizable artifacts. The theory is that biased generations ensures they produce text on a manifold under which they have high certainty.
@jctestud @henddkn @S_Gehrmann @MITIBMLab That is really interesting actually. Specifically it seems to know less about unicorns than the big model. https://t.co/WdnpJ0r63p

"@shoyer So, in the current code, I have an `self.op2(other, \x, y -&gt; op)` where you can unwrap both, but rename from self. I'm not sure that's the right way to go though, as the semantics is a bit unclear."

"@HammanHydro @SylvainCorlay @mxwlj @xarray_dev Look, I'm fully in agreement. This is the right data model, but the Pandas emphasis is confusing branding and I have no clue what NetCDF is. We need to convince the deep learning community this is the right tool by having it work with pytorch etc."

"@JacobDHinkle Feel free to hack away or send PRs. It's definitely a prototype at the moment, but there are tests. It sounds like the next step is to allow indexing by object/type, and then implement resolution or use pythons out of the box."
@JacobDHinkle This sounds very neat. I think this route would require honestly setting up a type system though. Not sure I would want to fake it with strings.
@ankurhandos @recurseparadox Can you give an example? Fun to think through the hard cases.
"@alexmwalther Yup, this is inspired by namedtuple and more recently dataclass, which I think is a really nice change to the python landscape."

@ekshakhs @PyTorch This is really neat. I will add it to the post.
"@HammanHydro @mxwlj @xarray_dev Yeah, from the other comments it is clear that xarray has 90% of this functionality. I think I found the documentation confusing on first read because I thought it was a Pandas replacement. The other issue is just that pytorch tensor is not numpy api compatible so we need a shim."
"@shoyer @chrisemoody Huh, this is great and basically the same. I definitely should have googled harder, although it is nice to know there is agreement on the interface."
"@shoyer @chrisemoody Not sure the einops stuff is that important. Maybe I'll switch to just implementing the xarray spec in torch (maybe without the pandas/dataframe stuff). Next interesting question is ""typed"" interop with the rest of pytorch."
"@chrisemoody @shoyer This someone else brought this up in the thread. Seems like an important end goal.

https://t.co/6DAZ8tnTRa"
@egrefen @PyTorch That's fair. I tried to make it clear that I mean the class and not the mathematical object. However I do think a lot of math notation we consider beautiful has inherent abstraction issues.
"@dga_smith @ftzo Cool, yeah, I think I'm using this internally. The further step this takes is to have persistent tokens across calls, and to avoid unpacking all the dimensions when doing contraction."
@HammanHydro @mxwlj @xarray_dev Yeah. I actually didn't know about xarray before writing this. But I did call it out in the introduction. I'll try to merge with it more.
"@joelgrus @michalwols Oh I see, that's really cool! So instead of `v.mean(""hidden"")` I should structure it like `v.hidden.mean()` or something so that it can autocomplete (if it has a type)."
@michalwols @joelgrus But how is this different than argument ordering in function calls? Changing the name of a dimension should be as trivial as a key-word arg to a function. Just read the docs and change the dimension to the right name.
"@joelgrus @michalwols While I agree in theory, the distinction between runtime and compile time in neural networks is blurry. If your job takes 8 hours to run, the first pass is indistinguishable from compile time."
"@recurseparadox I do this too, but it honestly is a write-only approach. You get it correct, but then no one can understand your code later."
"@michalwols This also would be useful, also it comes up much less in my applications. PyTorch distributions implements something similar https://t.co/d93vRJ4u94"
"@michalwols This is very neat, I will add a link. I was trying to think of a way to annotate functions, this seems like the best way to do it. Maybe we can chat some more."
"@colinraffel Or even ideally, they both become no-ops and a jit like XLA decides what the true low-level operations based on the expected contractions. Not sure how far we are from that world though."
"@ctongfei @sjmielke Oh neat, yeah nexus seems like exactly what I would like if we had static checks. I'll add a link."
"@JacobDHinkle Glad to hear! I was inspired by named records versus tuples. However so many neat Haskell ideas, would be cool to take it further."
"@DCasBol @colinraffel Does attention break? As long as you have a ""key"" dimension it should work independently of other sizes. You just have to shift it to be called key before passing it in."
"@colinraffel I guess my argument is that this happens already, and we are just doing it with transpose and comments. This makes that convention explicit. You need to shift at the code boundaries or alternatively lift other functions to your convention."

"@haldaume3 @yoavgo @alvations no gain in bleu, small in model (it would be weird if that didn't go up a tiny bit though). Maybe we can post."
@haldaume3 @yoavgo @alvations what experiment would convince you? We ran beams to 1000 saw no change in score.  Possibly because of training
"@haldaume3 @yoavgo @alvations think it mattered in lin. models. Story of ""inference"" in neu. models may be open. Would love to know more."

@chris_brockett alternatively is there some sort of shared mechanical turk script that can be used for eval and distributed.

What's the most important science issue facing your state? @PopSci has you covered. https://t.co/jUsvS3Xm0l
"""Our goal is to understand the universe"" —Chryssa Kouveliotou. To do that, we need to start with the Milky Way, then apply what we learn to other galaxies #xraygalaxy #sciwri18"
"Among many other objects (x-ray binaries and magnetars and flaring stars, oh my), the Deep Galactic Plane Survey has discovered a solar analog—an object like our own sun! #xraygalaxy #sciwri18"
"Now on to magnetars (neutron stars w/ strong magnetic fields)! Only know of 28 in the Milky Way, but the Deep Galactic Plane Survey expects to find 5-10 new bright, and up to 47 new dim ones. Maybe learn how they evolve, connection to pulsars and FRBs #xraygalaxy #sciwri18"
The Deep Galactic Plane Survey expects to complete the census of high-mass x-ray binaries (heavy object orbiting a neutron star or black hole) in the Milky Way. That could tell us the formation rate of massive stars in our galaxy; apply info to others #xraygalaxy #sciwri18
"One of Chryssa Kouveliotou's ""daring visions"" goals: ""Reconstruct the complete star formation, structural and chemical history of our Milky Way and its neighbors"" #XrayGalaxy #sciwri18"
"Kathleen Hall Jamieson doesn't use the term ""fake news""—prefers ""viral deception"" or VD. You don't want to catch it... #SciMediaNarratives #SciWri18"
Issue is not just with science coverage but with the headlines that frame articles—people will interpret the rest of the story thru the headline. Per Kathleen Hall Jamieson #SciMediaNarratives #SciWri18
"Plus, gotta love her sparring match with @carlzimmer"
@r_heisman Oh no! This conference could use some time-turners
"Loving this #SciMediaNarratives session. Kathleen Jamieson is a really amazing speaker—obviously knowledgeable, but also passionate and funny, and she gave us actionable recommendations for solutions. #SciWri18"
"The counterfeit and to the ""science is broken"" narratives result in the same effect: reduced trust in science &amp; scientists (and reduced funding). Why? ""When something is evocative and dramatic, you overgeneralize it."" —Kathleen Hall Jamieson #SciMediaNarratives  #SciWri18"
@tiffanylohwater Kathleen Hall Jamieson at the  #SciMediaNarratives session
"Problem with the narrative of “Science is broken/in crisis”: In a polarized political environment, it’s easy for politicians to take those stories and say, as a result, that we don’t have to accept any scientific findings #scimedianarratives #sciwri18"
"Journalists, publicists, scientists: Everybody has a role and the role is different, but everyone should be thinking about how, eventually, we get the info that's needed to the public #scimedianarratives #sciwri18"
"Kicking off #SciMediaNarratives with a comment on #scidebate: ""I think the job of science journalists is faithfully reporting science, and in the process, if the science isn’t trustworthy, to point that out."" — Kathleen Hall Jamieson #sciwri18"
"@LizzieGibney: Even physicists disagree about exactly what is going on with quantum weirdness &amp; what it means. The one thing they agree on: the mathematics. (Hence the motto, ""Shut up and calculate."") But journalists can't fill a story with equations! #quantumania #sciwri18"
"@LizzieGibney: There are a lot of marginal advances in QC. When you get a press release, you have to decide not just how to write a story but whether to write it in the first place"
@LizzieGibney: The writer's priority is to the reader—make sure they have the best grasp they can (intuitively) of what’s going on. Then repeat your idea back to a friendly physicist and ask if anything is wrong with it. #quantumania #sciwri18
"@LizzieGibney: When you're covering new studies that describe a specific advance, you don’t want to spend a lot of time giving definitions. So use hyperlinks to previous coverage that can explain in more detail (for those who want to read it) #quantumania #sciwri18"
"Per @LizzieGibney: QC is hard to explain because entanglement and superposition are not intuitive—they’re not how things behave in the everyday world. BUT you don't need to be an expert: ""“If I can do it, so can you—don’t be afraid of quantum physics!” #quantumania #sciwri18"
HA somebody else asked the pun question and the answer is yes!
"Right now, there's a divide between universities (which understand theory very well but don't make products for third parties) and industry (which is less comfortable with theory and better with building things) per Christopher Monroe #quantumania #sciwri18"
"""Quantum computers require exotic hardware because they involve exotic rules"" — Christopher Monroe. They need extreme isolation #quantumania #sciwri18"
@LizzieGibney's #Quantumania talk was so helpful that I was too busy taking notes to live-tweet; I'll post some takeaways in a bit #sciwri18
Emily Edwards has been working on The Quantum Atlas: “a glossary that includes a little bit for (hopefully) everyone” (is that a quantum computing pun?) with illustrations and visual interactives #quantumania #sciwri18
"In order to convey complex ideas (like quantum supremacy, qubit, quantum many-body physics), need a visual language for them — Emily Edwards at #Quantumania #sciwri18"
"The big money application of quantum computers: factoring numbers, which is the basis of some crypto systems — @orzelc at #Quantumania #sciwri18"
Looking forward to hearing about quantum physics—and advice on how to talk about it—at #Quantumania #sciwri18
"How to turn data on domestic violence into concrete change? ""This is where I think activism comes into it. Gov'ts and police don’t change their habits just because there’s a law."" — @MaryEllsberg Need a strong autonomous women's movement #violencewhatworks #sciwri18"
"Back to that original prevalence study in Leon, Nicaragua. Between 1995 and 2016, the lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence has decreased, *particularly* among younger women who grew up knowing that domestic violence is against the law #violencewhatworks #sciwri18"
"A few small local projects have shown that it's possible to reduce violence against women and girls. The question is, how to scale those up to prevent violence on a larger national/global level? #violencewhatworks #sciwri18"
"In conflicted South Sudan, prevalence study showed that many women experienced violence from non-partners...but TWICE AS MANY had been raped or beaten by their intimate partners. That's double the global rates of domestic violence, per @MaryEllsberg. #violencewhatworks #sciwri18"
"Over the course of ~20 years, researchers have done many more prevalence studies. They now have data from 85 different countries, and on average “about 1 in 3 women over their lifetime will experience physical or sexual violence” —@MaryEllsberg #violencewhatworks #sciwri18"
"During @MaryEllsberg's first prevalence study of violence against women and girls, 488 women were interviewed in Leon, Nicaragua. 1 in 2 of married women had experienced physical or sexual abuse by an intimate partner #violencewhatworks @sciwri18"
"""Main finding of almost 2 decades of research is that women and girls are overwhelmingly at greater risk of violence from someone they know and trust."" — @MaryEllsberg at #ViolenceWhatWorks session of #sciwri18"
"Someone asked the #livescienceinterviewing panel what NOT to do in a live interview. General consensus: Don't be mean to the guest and don't be unprepared. Or as @drkiki puts it, ""Don't be a jerkface."" #sciwri18"
"""Create high-concept visual analogies"" like comparing exposure therapy to filling a punch card — @AliMattu at #scivid #sciwri18"
"On YouTube, ""Lead with awesome"" — @AliMattu at #scivid. Example: he opened a video with a shot of him freaking out about bees. #sciwri18"
@AliMattu turned to YouTube to change the perception of cognitive behavioral therapy (which gets a...less than positive portrayal in pop culture) because it's a good platform for sharing emotions #scivid #sciwri18

"For any video, ""You need good characters and you need good visuals."" — @DrJoeHanson at #scivid #sciwri18"
“They’re a little weird when viewed outside the context of YouTube.”— @DrJoeHanson on his videos. The style should take into account the platform where the video appears #SciVid #sciwri18
"When writing a script: ""Look for the moments of humanity in an interview and then build the stories around that"" — @elcwt at #SciVid #sciwri18"
"“Recognize that the camera is a really intimidating presence in the room” — @elcwt on #SciVid . An interviewer should try to be over-present, give interviewees something to engage with (other than the camera) #sciwri18"

"@DCasBol Thanks for your interest @DCasBol ! Yes, it would be very nice to do this kind of training in multiple layers."
It is also nice to see that NNL-CONV layers lead to a higher accuracy than standard CONV units when applied to images with shadows. @MITIBMLab @PrincetonNeuro https://t.co/V5rg86Ti74
We continue investigating local unsupervised learning https://t.co/KNGdhsJzKr The most intriguing result is that the filters that result from local learning naturally fall into several groups that qualitatively resemble optimal stimuli of “blob” and “interblob” neurons in V1. https://t.co/48IbWQjgOX

@mthiboust @PrincetonNeuro @Numenta The learning rules on slide 60 are very biological and seem to make perfect sense. Conceptually they are in the same “universality class” as the learning rules that we study. I would be curious to see some benchmarking of how they work. @SubutaiAhmad
@F_Vaggi @IBMResearch This is a standard benchmarking trick in ML. You require that the accuracy of the model does not change if you apply a random but fixed (for all data points) permutation of pixels to all the images in the training and the test sets.
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura Yup, I am."
"@Princeton @PrincetonNeuro @the_IAS Also, check out a blog from @IBMResearch and @MITIBMLab available here: https://t.co/UQoMisNEuH"
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura No, all the experiments in this paper use fully connected nets only. And completely agreed on the convolutions."
"@JWaschura @IBMResearch Backprop in one layer can be written as a local learning rule. We comment on this issue in the second paragraph of the discussion. You can also use a perceptron learning rule to train the top classifier, if you like. This should not change the results significantly."
"@F_Vaggi @IBMResearch Random weights work much worse. Also, the tasks that we studied are pixel permutation invariant, so we used fully connected nets only, no convolutions."
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura We tried training deeper networks with more than one hidden layer, but we did not see an improvement in accuracy compared to the networks with one hidden layer. This is perhaps because the datasets that we studied are very simple - pixel permutation invariant MNIST and CIFAR."
"@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura It took a couple of hours to produce weights for Fig.6 in the paper, but they were calculated in parallel on different CPUs."
@Love2Code @IBMResearch @JWaschura For all the experiments we used IBM’s DLAAS. The code that I posted on GitHub works best on a fast CPU. It is not optimized for speed. I just tried to make the notebook as simple and transparent as possible so that the theoretical idea behind the algorithm is clear.

@j2bryson I agree. But the societal push for human rights is often fueled by empathy. So how do you realistically get to a place to be able to legislate without that fuel? You need both.

I will even buy the winning family a delicious cup of hot chocolate as part of our tour. Hopefully it will serve as a useful distraction for when I need to hastily look at the exhibition labels to pretend I know what I'm talking about..

I have some BIG NEWS for you today. Announcement number one of two coming up shortly..
"@jackmar10745832 @flyk6cr Mmm. Although, to be fair, I said the debate was over, not the science. We didn't wait until we had a complete and total understanding of gravity before building spaceships and aircraft, and we shouldn't wait to address the risk to the planet either."
"@flyk6cr Also, I don't think science ever deals in absolute truths - it exists to invite scrutiny. But the situation is subtler than that. We're at the point where the overwhelming weight of evidence points in a single direction. But even if it didn't - do we really want to take the risk?"
@flyk6cr I haven't come across that particular claim about all life ending. That's certainly not my reading of the reasons behind the current urgency. Do you have a link?
@flyk6cr Mmmm. But the debate is over. This is no longer a science issue for scientists with their science qualifications. This is everybody's future. And Greta - as a non-scientist - is perfectly placed to lead the charge on making that apparent.

@ludvignordqvist @fovlsbane My bad. Think the point still stands..
@William_Leech The course is set up as a kind of mega longitudinal study about how people learn. The idea is to repeatedly iterate the course over time to optimise the learning experience.
"@William_Leech Definitely not a stupid question! So I think it differs in a couple of key ways. First, there’s a real focus on anchoring the examples in reality. Eg. My stream is all around the calculus of happiness. Second - my favourite thing..."
@jimalkhalili The very same. I only didn’t name check it because (sssh) principia doesn’t actually have that much calculus in it..
@djbrobertson And you can flip between the instructors for different parts to find an example that resonates with you!
"@djbrobertson Oh oh ohhh but this is the BEAUTY of the courses we’ve designed. These are the top level headers to match the existing textbooks, but all the way through everything is anchored in reality. John’s: calculus of sport. Mine: calculus of happiness. Tim’s: all kinds of wonderful stuff"

"@Poyonoz @roydanroy I certainly hope so, and that we can move beyond looking at some samples in awe as a method for scientific evaluation and rigour : )"
@roydanroy Thanks! There are a couple of related works that we will cite in the next iteration. Main differences: We can now make it a metric as ImageNet trains in minutes (cheaply). Generative models are much better. And we evaluate a wider variety of models (not only GANs).
"Evaluating generative models is hard! We propose Classification Accuracy Score from classifiers trained on generated data:

-Accuracy of 43% when trained purely on BigGAN samples (vs 73%)

1. The accuracy of p(y|x) JUST by sampling a GAN is interesting. It is not as good as data, but it's not bad either!
2. Trivial shifting of a few pixels left and right is necessary. I think GANs &amp; al may do something more useful sometime : )"

@tim_bluenose @Kasparov63 I don't agree. MaNa played a regular game. He wasn't asked to not build some units or don't do certain things. But of course we did play only one of (the full) matchups possible.
"@jods16 The never seen before maps is harder to tell. But I believe all of these are possible. In fact we had an early bug in our ladder where the network was playing on more maps and it was fine (not as good, but playing reasonably)."
@Ferdi_oo_ @demishassabis Pure self play tends to generate worker rushes / mass basic units all ins. But I'm sure there is room for research.
@Ferdi_oo_ @demishassabis If it learnt from scratch it could bypass certain things players do that aren't optimal. But then exploration becomes much much harder. Future work? : )

@NickFerran @thomasllewis Particularly in later stages of training I think you should stay in a department for at least a year. Trust needs to develop on both sides. Speaking to US colleagues who stay in same (large) hospital describe major benefits with fellowships used to broaden experience

@chrisgdclarke Hi Christopher. Figures presented recently showed %age of F2s entering speciality training had halved since 2011. Will take time to know how many from 2018 cohort choose to build a career in the NHS but I’m not sure it will be most based on history. Workplace wellbeing ⬇️ not ⬆️
"@jessrmorley @MattFenech83 Although I’d add that designers, engineers and many others as critical to success. Multidisciplinary teams as important in health tech as they are in medicine"
@SDawlatly Agree not clear yet Samir. But if you look at application ratios they’ve dropped significantly in recent years. Training programmes in previously competitive specialities and regions can’t fill places. Not convinced people are choosing short term posts as long term career
@jessrmorley @MattFenech83 I can’t point to any interesting advanced healthcare technology (digital health +/- AI) that hasn’t been driven by a lived experience of the problem being solved. Essential to involve care givers or patients in the process. Ideally both!
@christinezoo @trentconsultant My concern would be that if we don’t fix issues downstream then 50% —&gt; 60% —&gt; 70%. Worth noting in article that many talented clinicians are going to work in other health systems not leaving medicine altogether
@HarryAEvans @IndraJoshi10 @DrHughHarvey @hssood @Maxi_Macki @benthebray Important to make sure algorithms aren't entrenching current biases but I'm optimistic on the ultimate potential for reducing inequality. AI deployed thoughtfully could help to reduce unwarranted variation and lack of access that impacts most on those without money/voice.

"@togelius @rplevy @IntuitMachine @fchollet @bengoertzel I did indeed :-)  Someone used the term about ten years before me but their workshop paper was sufficiently obscure that by 2001, when I had the idea for the term, I couldn't find any use of it with Google.

"But while they can survive harsh environments in a hibernation like “tun” state, tardigrades are actually fragile creatures that can be hurt or killed easily—even by single-celled organisms. 

Nevertheless, they are incredible animals, so here are a few tardigrade fun facts:"
"Widely known for their unusual hardiness in the face of extreme cold, heat and radiation, they have been called “invincible” or “immortal.”"

If you have good ideas on that, please let me know :)"
"@wightmanr @A_K_Nain @quantombone @cmarschner @quocleix @NvidiaAI You might want to compare EfficientNet-B0 with ResNet101 , since they have similar ImageNet acc (77.3%).

"@jeremyphoward @wightmanr @quocleix Good to know! How much improvement did you get?

IIRC, by changing the last stride=2 to stride=1 (final output shape becomes 14x14) for Efficientnet-B0, you would get around 1% accuracy gain, with the cost of more computations in the last few layers."
"@jeremyphoward @wightmanr @quocleix Excellent question!

It is more like a tradition. However, later stage layers need a lot of params, so it is better to not add many extra layers in later stage if #params is a concern.

"@ogrisel Yes, you're correct."
Bigger models are better models so we built GPipe to enable training of large models. Results: 84.3% on ImageNet with AmoebaNet (big jump from other state-of-art models) and 99% on CIFAR-10 with transfer learning. Link: https://t.co/SE7Dz2cA0g https://t.co/C6vrpD7rRe
"@maithra_raghu Congrats, Maithra!"
@Marcin_Pekalski Yes.
"@elesinOlalekan Yes, I think it's possible if you have enough supervised data. That said, I think this problem is better formulated as an RL problem where the reward is measured by executing the SQL query on a database. Reference: https://t.co/GGiklkHzZD"

"4. The AI community now has some new tools to use in similar situations (staged release, partnership-based sharing) but will need further innovation to deal with increasingly challenging release decisions. See the report for more on this."
"3. Tracking language model impacts is hard! We’ve done our best to assess the prospects for beneficial applications and misuse, but have limited information and have indicated this. Risk assessments must be humble in the face of motivated actors like states that might misuse LMs."
"2. A related point is the need for cross-organizational communication and collaboration. Working with others in the AI community, we’ve been excited to share lessons across GPT-2 and related language models like GROVER, CTRL, etc."
"1. One clear takeaway from the GPT-2 case is the critical importance of diverse disciplinary perspectives in addressing responsible publication. This is reflected in the snowballing authors list and references in the report, and in the multifaceted risk analysis we put forward."

"@pfau @SimonDeDeo Thanks for the link!

"@pfau @SimonDeDeo I know you do, but FWIW in a discussion of who is re-defining things, making up a definition on the spot is unpersuasive. I looked up several defs not made by us and they all seem to encompass what fine-tuning is doing."
"@pfau @SimonDeDeo Certainly there are transfer learning tasks/sub-areas that I would not say fine-tuning is a plausible path to achieving, e.g. explicit use of episodic memory for improved one-shot learning or something. But at a definitional level, I disagree - it is exactly transfer learning."

"@paul_scharre The US approach to Iranian visas, for example (indiscriminate cutoff with massive costs to academia/industry/individuals), does not inspire confidence that we are in a good political place for this currently, but I'd like to be proven wrong."
"@paul_scharre I would love to hear more about realistic opportunities for that happening, and would like to see such things happen. But my impression is that a more likely scenario resulting from this sort of high profile China bashing is a net decline."
"@paul_scharre I'm simplifying here to make this point, too, of course - one would need to unpack what the filtering mechanisms are/scales of good/bad/costs of policy implementation in terms of America's reputation etc. to say anything super crisp here."
"@paul_scharre Agree more/less is too simplistic, but more/less *at the current rate of abuse* is a coherent question, especially if it is difficult to filter the good from the bad. I claim that the good significantly outweighs the bad, and that a general decline would therefore be bad."
@paul_scharre See the end of my thread :) not sure we disagree.
"@EBKania If anything visa-related is a ""weapon"" in global innovation (though zero-sum thinking is super problematic as applied to science), it's the United States's historical openness to foreign researchers, which brings new ideas/perspectives and augments our very bad STEM pipeline."
"@EBKania ...and that starts with recognizing that China is by far the biggest source of foreign PhD students, and that from a competitiveness perspective, visas are vastly under- rather than over-supplied currently--the US gets massive benefits from research happening within its borders."
"Also, as folks who have looked at these issues such as @EBKania have noted, one can be concerned about/act on misuse of visas without overreacting and throwing the baby out with the bathwater. To make progress, though, politicians need a semi accurate mental model of US science.."

@gneubig @alienelf I’d be curious if you have a different take! :) I’m admittedly not very calibrated on how significant the drops are + what compression one might have reasonably expected here.
"@gneubig @alienelf And I should in retrospect prob not have exclusively focused on the size of the smallest model. Perhaps in terms of impressiveness (to me) of performance retention given a compression ratio, maybe the 10x bigger one is more impressive, or none are, depending on your comparisons"
"@gneubig @alienelf Yeah, I almost followed up with elaboration on that term, which was pretty vague/can see why it seems super wrong as stated. The drop is less than I’d have expected given the compression ratio, though it is a substantial drop in performance"

"@paul_scharre (Basically the sorts of stuff you discuss on your recent LAWS piece - a mix of doctrine, no first use norms, audit logs, etc. is needed to address each mechanism’s limitations. So def not a panacea (software) but a key ingredient of the puzzle"
"@paul_scharre Namely, reversibility of software (~equivalent to a short breakout period in nuclear). To have assurance that a vetted system is the system being used in the field, or that no *other* disallowed systems exist, would require additional accoutrements beyond just checking code"
"@paul_scharre (Controls on software may be equivalent to what I said, depending on what you mean! :) just wanted to be clear on controlling OF its distribution (hard) vs using it to make certain systems/operations more transparent - which does have the challenges you mentioned"
"@paul_scharre I wouldn’t nec. phrase it as “controls on software,” which sets up precisely the impossibility claim that tech cos make. Rather, I’d say software is a component of many regulatory apparatuses, both domestically (cars, planes) and internationally (software side of nukes)"

@zacharylipton Maybe worth considering Gnomon! Haven't heard it on audiobook but found it fascinating on the page... super wild.
@mmitchell_ai So sorry to hear about this.
"@yiming_lin__ @jjding99 Seems like sort of a different issue from what we were discussing, but - protest can be both non-violent and violent (the way I use the term at least)"
@jachiam0 All good points! Though I think that’s consistent with e.g. many of Mr. Plinkett’s points also being true. :)
@GoAbiAryan I want to see this equation now 😂
"@yiming_lin__ @jjding99 Though I think it not being a FR camera per se does not mean FR is irrelevant to it, or that protesters are wrong to worry about FR."
"@yiming_lin__ Had a long discussion with @jjding99 and others about this (see my replies to comments on my original tweet) - in short, I agree specificity re: FR vs surveillance etc. is important, and I should have been more caveated in the original tweet re: not being sure what the tower is"
"@GoAbiAryan Seems that relationship quality is a key variable here. If there are new goals being added to your plate that you don’t like, that’s bad, but jointly pursuing a common goals/set of goals can be good for both parties."
"@jachiam0 But relatively speaking, I think old&gt;prequel is true"
"@jachiam0 Had to compress lol. What’s your view? There are definitely gradations (3&gt;2&gt;1), and I am not of the view we should pretend they didn’t happen/never watch them..."
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Also, sidenote: I just got the gangster thing lol, thought you were referring to some well known protester. I agree that account is not a reliable source of info"
@jjding99 @dryellowbean (Context: it is *not hard* to start using FR today. Could easily have started in June technically speaking)
@jjding99 @dryellowbean *re:
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean To be clear: that was much earlier in the crisis, yes? I think we are aligned now reS the original tweet though"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean (And you may not find out for years - again, happens all the time elsewhere)"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Again, vagueness is the enemy here. They could e.g. say that something is not CCTV+FR integration for a zillion reasons"
@jjding99 @dryellowbean I’d have to know more about HK law/culture etc to know if that statement can be taken at face value.
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Oh also: I am extra skeptical bc it was a backwards looking statement (nothing about future plans), months ago. But would still be skeptical of a vague claim today."
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean It seems like we don’t have a ton of hard data to go on, just contextualizing why I am unimpressed :)"
@jjding99 @dryellowbean I regularly see police lie or mislead about FR
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Interesting, we have v diff interpretations of that statement :) Especially in the context of policing, one should not rely on vague statements as a source of ground truth - and the denial of the follow up request basically obviates the significance of the first statement"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean I think it is reasonable for protesters to think that surveillance tower feeds or still images could be run through FR (and, if it actually were a FR tower, even more so) given what I currently know about HK police statements/actions and general priors re: policing in a crisis"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean Hmm yeah in retrospect FR tower seems like overly strong language (without more info) and I’d be more comfortable with eg surveillance towers as a default term here. But I have not looked into it enough to be confident that isn’t FR related, and unless it is literally a dummy, +"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean To some extent I am transferring my priors from other cases, and maybe that’s inappropriate. But that is a super duper weak statement by the standards of such statements, and similar statements routinely turn out to be false."
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean (Given developments elsewhere, HK govt’s non stirling track record of transparency as I understand it, and the ample wiggle room in that statement, and the crisis situation - I don’t get much trust from that statement)"
"@jjding99 @dryellowbean I don’t see any tension between the tweet and this, but maybe misunderstanding! They denied the request for more info - unsurprising. They deny a certain very specific claim re integration of CCTV and FR - unsurprising."
@dryellowbean @jjding99 Hmm def not something I have expertise in! More familiar with Western FR developments generally/haven’t looked as closely at the HK situation as I’d ideally like
@wsisaac Glad it isn’t just me!
@dryellowbean @jjding99 Def doesn’t answer all Qs one might have though
@dryellowbean @jjding99 Not sure what Jeff meant to invoke exactly but think this is the article I assume he was referencing: https://t.co/7TH4F3qKnf
@jjding99 @pfau Maybe they meant the same thing though - not sure
"@jjding99 @pfau Yeah, and I also didn’t mean to endorse the tweet I quoted (which maybe implied it was a FR tower, but to me that distinction is not key so didn’t register as in need of clarification)"
"@jjding99 @pfau So the lack of known bad uses seems somewhat orthogonal to protesters being concerned about ubiquitous sources of surveillance data, regardless whether there is processing occurs onboard or offboard those devices, or whether all footage is processed in this way... thoughts?"
"@jjding99 @pfau Oh, I remember that article now, did read it actually. I did not come away very optimistic. It seems that, similarly to the West, use of FR is super opaque and unaccountable."

Is that me being old or is the Star Wars juggernaut out of control, or both?"
"@pfau Ah, yeah, I should be clear that I do not know if that specific tower/those towers have on-board processing, off-board, or no processing (just a scare tactic) - but in any case, probably on balance not good from a protest perspective."
"@pfau (whether used legitimately or illicitly, whether involving the HK gov't or the mainland, etc.)"
"@pfau Here's a pretty good article on some aspects of it (inc. use by both sides): https://t.co/cf6rD4Bt2F

And our future one matters too! BTW, we discuss the press coverage issue in the report published Tues FYI.."
"@RexDouglass (Vs. e.g. immediate release, for example. As noted in our report Tuesday, we don’t think this was the best possible version of AI community coordination, but an encouraging one overall IMO)."
"@RexDouglass I don’t think we lost as much model-related research time as one think, but def some. As to overall effectiveness of the approach, that’s harder to answer m but I am confident we enabled more time for useful research/debate/coordination prior to wide large model availability."
"@RexDouglass Certainly there are tradeoffs/opportunity costs in terms of research pace, which we have tried to manage (though not fully resolve) via model sharing with a small number of partners. Since most researchers who would have the model (if released) aren’t focused on detection/bias,"

"A tricky issue about replication is how to weigh talent, compute, algorithms, data, and other factors. The GPT-2 case makes clear, IMO, the critical importance of compute as an input to examine carefully in this context. (4/7)"
"In the last six months, we've coordinated with several replicators, and various technical developments (such as GROVER) helped bring GPT-2 within reach of a larger set of actors. We asked that communication be with our Policy team (languagequestions@openai.com) (3/7)"
"In our first GPT-2 blog post, we noted that researchers could replicate our results, but that our approach would limit the initial replicators, prevent malicious use, and enable more time for discussion and impact analysis. (2/7)"
"Given recent discussions of GPT-2 replication, I thought it'd be good to clarify some of OpenAI's general thinking on the issues of publication norms, compute, and staged release. (1/7)"

"@deku_a @primalpoly @vzeman79 I didn’t choose any hill to die on, but I still don’t see your interpretation of the tweet as realistic to his intent at all"
@DonSutherland66 @vzeman79 @primalpoly The disagreement isn’t about the importance of reducing violence but whether this is an incitement to violence at all (I think it is not)
"@Tiberius_Jonas @primalpoly That's what eradicating an idea means in practice (I wouldn't nec. use that term or analogy, but I assume this is roughly what he means), in a world where it is assumed that you don't just go around killing people you disagree with."
"@Tiberius_Jonas @primalpoly You are granting the definitional interpretation (he's talking about white nationalism) but then assuming that eradicating white nationalism means eradicating the ""infectious disease"" ""carriers"". That doesn't follow at all. What he and others are advocating is social change."
"@vzeman79 @primalpoly My grammatical point was that the difference in interpretation is about a noun (""white nationalism"" vs. ""Trump supporters"" being eradicated), not the verb."
"@primalpoly @vzeman79 So, if ""clearly"" and ""obviously"" are the relevant evidence here for both sides, clearly we won't make much progress in this discussion, unfortunately, which is sad, because I appreciate you replying. But we have super different priors here."
"@primalpoly @vzeman79 And did you consider the other interpretation of the sentence (in which he is ""obviously"" referring to the need for social change to eliminate white nationalism)? Why does that seem implausible to you as an interpretation?"
"@primalpoly @vzeman79 Not sure why you jumped to the unfollow thing, seems irrelevant to the matter at hand. 

So, ""obviously"", ""inciting,"" ""violence"" - you think that Reza intents (inciting) to cause violence to occur to...random Trump supporters? What exactly?"
"@vzeman79 @primalpoly ""Plain and simple"" in your case means ""assuming that a sentence meant genocide when a different plausible interpretation is that it didn't."" Specifically, the final sentence--to me, given the context of the earlier sentences--is about white nationalism, hence our disagreement"
"@vzeman79 @primalpoly If you seriously are worried about Reza Azlan inciting violence then I think you have your priorities super out of whack, but I'll keep talking to you if you tell me that is genuinely what you think."
"@vzeman79 @primalpoly ...and rightly, many people are wondering what can be done to stop that--and one doesn't have to look hard to find such explicit hate and genocidal language--Reza's tweet was no such thing and this quote-tweet seemed miscalibrated, so I said so."
"@vzeman79 @primalpoly I read the tweet as well! But it is a big step from ""there is a bad thing in society and many people are contributing to it"" to ""eliminate these people."" Whereas there is a huge segment of society that says ""eliminate these people"" and some of them massacred ppl this week,"
"@primalpoly Considering that quote-tweeting someone is generally considered aggressive, maybe consider alternative interpretations before lambasting people?"
"@primalpoly You of all people should know about the motivated reasoning that occurs when you read things from people you don't like... To readers without your priors, it is pretty obvious that Reza was referring to white nationalism as the scourge to be eradicated."

"First, we have no finite way of describing the trajectory of the light rays on this stage. 4/8"
"The solutions I study are like the light, but the stage on which they shine is full of obstacles. 3/8"
Your task is to find out where the light from that torch goes infinitely far away to your right. This is called a connection problem. 2/8

@imagineNICE Pleasure
@puretemerity 😃
"End of chapter 1 

#Cilliers"
It should be clear that I wish to argue that connectionist models are more useful for the understanding and modelling of complex systems than are  rule-based models. #Cilliers
Comparing rule-based and connectionist models #Cilliers https://t.co/UAmQjMukYq
Connectionist models #Cilliers https://t.co/TaGkeEEhNQ
"In general there is a split between the supporters of strong AI, who claim that formal systems provide an adequate model for all aspects of human intelligence, and the supporters of weak AI, who merely see formal systems as a powerful tool. #Cilliers"
"Can a system like natural language or the human brain really be reduced to a set of rules? Classical AI claims that it can. [#Cilliers doesn't think so] 

Before turning to another approach, let me summarise the main characteristics of rule-based systems: https://t.co/NHXzyVis0v"
"On the one hand, models of complexity will only become successful in scientific practice once we begin to understand more about the nature of complexity. On the other hand, our understanding will only improve if we actually test our models scientifically.  #Cilliers"
"One can say that science without philosophy is blind, and philosophy without science is paralysed. #Cilliers"
"&lt;- This does not imply that a complex system contains some form of internal ‘subject’ that controls the behaviour of the system; in fact, the whole notion of central control becomes suspect. #Cilliers"
"Claiming an external designer (or Designer) merely begs the question of the origin of complexity, and we have to find mechanisms by which a system can acquire and adapt its internal structure on an evolutionary basis. The key concept here is the notion of self-organisation."
"A complex system, such as a living organism or a growing economy, has to develop its structure and be able to adapt that structure in order to cope with changes in the environment. #Cilliers"
"In order to respond appropriately to its environment, a complex system must be able to gather information about that environment and store it for future use. Meaning, the structure of the system cannot consist of a random collection of elements; they must have some meaning."
"To describe a complex system you have, in a certain sense, to repeat the system. #Cilliers"
"A complex system cannot be reduced to a collection of its basic constituents, not because the system is not constituted by them, but because too much of the relational information gets lost in the process. #Cilliers"
"Despite the elegance of the entropy theory, it is not an adequate model for the understanding of complex systems like human cognition (see Katz and Dorfman 1992), where the intricate structure certainly cannot be equated with ‘randomness’. #Cilliers https://t.co/npKj7BEPIc"
&lt;- To what extent is this possible? #Cilliers
"The ten characteristics proposed here help us to talk about complexity in a qualitative way, but do not provide us with a method to measure complexity. We would like to be able to deal with complexity in a more quantitative way, especially when modelling complex systems."
"In developing a description of the characteristics of complex systems, I offer the following list: 

#Cilliers https://t.co/HOEWCVIbIa"
"Many systems appear simple, but reveal remarkable complexity when examined closely (e.g. a leaf). Others appear complex, but can be
described simply, e.g. some machines, such as the internal combustion engine. #Cilliers"
"The distinction between ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ is not as sharp as we may intuitively think. -&gt; 

#Cilliers"
"&lt;- This can hardly serve as definition, but perhaps one should not be surprised if complexity cannot be given a simple definition. #Cilliers"
"Unfortunately the concept [‘complexity’] remains elusive at both the qualitative and quantitative levels. One useful description, by Luhmann states that complexity entails that, in a system, there are more possibilities than can be actualised. #Cilliers"
"The rise of powerful technology is not an unconditional blessing. We have to deal with what we do not understand, and that demands new ways of thinking. #Cilliers"
"A complex system is not constituted merely by the sum of its components, but also by the intricate relationships between these components. In ‘cutting up’ a system, the analytical method destroys what it seeks to understand.  #Cilliers"
"If something is really complex, it cannot be adequately described by means of a simple theory. #Cilliers"
"&lt;- Moreover, these relationships are not fixed, but shift and change, often as a result of self-organisation. This can result in novel features, usually referred to in terms of emergent properties. The brain, natural language and social systems are complex.  #Cilliers"
"In a complex system, the interaction among constituents of the system and the interaction between the system and its environment, are of such a nature that the system as a whole cannot be fully understood simply by analysing its components.  #Cilliers"
"‘Complex’ and ‘complicated’: If a system—despite the fact that it may consist of a huge number of components—can be given a complete description in terms of its individual constituents, such a system is merely complicated. #Cilliers"

And that's it! The end of #LinguisticBodies
"We have often seen in this book that the experience and knowledge of practitioners, parents, workers, children, and social movements provide the richest examples for counteracting the functionalist hegemony in the sciences of the mind. #LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- This segregation is unfortunate since those engaged in nonacademic pursuits may be more skilled in the ethics of participation, that is, in the art of engaging the world as a coparticipant. #LinguisticBodies"
"Institutionally sanctioned separation between science, ethics &amp; politics, between the “Main Research Proposal” &amp; “Ethical Issues Appendix” confines research conversations to the echo chamber of unending commentary; academic knowledge is thus kept apart from other human practices."
"&lt;- When such barriers frame research language (scientific on one side, ethical-political on the other), we should question them critically and, as we have tried to do in this book, subvert linguistic and disciplinary conventions. #LinguisticBodies"
"Too often one encounters this separation between knowledge and ethics in the black-and-white epistemology of scientism (knowledge is value-free, what we do with knowledge is not). #LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- changes to this state of affairs must come from struggles over how to best become ethical-critical linguistic bodies in communities of human practice and relating—struggles over ideas, over language, over meanings and power. #LinguisticBodies"
"On the contrary, because outcomes are not guaranteed, because ideologies can endure that create massive inequalities, systematic injustices, and pervasive suffering for generations (and do so by morally recuperating self-centered interest as “natural”) -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- If it did, there would be no ethical agency to worry about, only pathologies: we would just have to cure those who have strayed from becoming “true” human selves. #LinguisticBodies"
"Being with others is indeed a given and participation a constitutive part of existing in a linguistic community, but this does not immediately set us on the path of universal collaboration toward the good. -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
"Human “nature,” if we can say anything about it, is the struggle for resolving tensions in community being and collectively and individually abiding in potentiality, and often failing to do one or the other.  #LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- If we are to avoid walking those alleys that lead to dualism and mysticism, we must keep close the notion of ethical know-how as a practice while acknowledging the multiple fundamental ambiguities of linguistic bodies. #LinguisticBodies"
"Self and other (or rather “selfing” and “othering”) are material processes and not metaphysical boundaries that precede these activities. -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
"If bodies bring forth a world through their enactments, then in facing another body I am confronted with a radical difference, I am confronted with someone else’s world, irreducible to mine. #LinguisticBodies"
"It seems a stretch to claim that participatory sense-making takes place in these situations, but ling bodies do make sense of posted parking ordinances, political messages on bumper stickers, advertisements, abruptly ubiquitous phrases (e.g., “fake news”), the memes of the day."
"&lt;- Put differently, we are addressed not only by other linguistic bodies, but also by utterances that issue seemingly from nowhere and no one, utterances without an enunciator. Consider billboards, buzzwords, and many forms of signage. #LinguisticBodies"
"Linguistic bodies struggle for meaning, recognition, and self-determination not only within institutional settings but also with institutions and other instruments of power and authority. #LinguisticBodies"
Enactive theory cannot endorse a plea for neutral discourse. Sense-making is never neutral. #LinguisticBodies
"Microaggressions are real and damaging behaviors; they are material carriers of domination and privilege, regardless of the varying degrees of privilege that the bodies enacting them enjoy. #LinguisticBodies"
"Microaggressions threaten to dismantle linguistic bodies, functioning through a sort of reductive strategy: a person is described through some bodily feature (e.g., sexual aspects, hair texture, apparent disabilities). #LinguisticBodies"
"Microaggressions are utterances directed at bodies that are in fact entanglements of organic, sensorimotor, &amp; intersubjective bodies, thus showing up in a particular way in a social world—gendered, raced, weighted, abled, accented, literate or not. #LinguisticBodies"
"Consider the phenomenon of microaggression. “the major vehicle for racism in this country [the US] is offenses done to blacks by whites in this sort of gratuitous never-ending way...""  #LinguisticBodies https://t.co/Dhq6ObEI0x"
"&lt;- Such complexity manifests in a variety of ways in interpersonal exchanges, and sustains an excitable field—in some cases one is tempted to say a minefield—of potential harms. #LinguisticBodies"
"The primordial tension of participatory sense-making is a tension between individual and interactive orders of constitutive normativity, but for linguistic bodies, tensions between past and present, and self and community, amplify and distort this basic ongoing challenge."
A frequent arena in which linguistic vulnerabilities are met and undergone is the scene of social interactions. #LinguisticBodies
"The voices of others find an echo chamber in the flow of self-directed utterances &amp; may not be easily silenced. Since utterances are constitutive of the ling self &amp; of relations to others, in these embodied resonances, words sometimes cause harm &amp; other times remedy injuries."
Languaging is never free from risk and sometimes it can feel like walking a tightrope. #LinguisticBodies
There cannot be ethical agency that at some level is not also potentially critical. #LinguisticBodies
"We may learn something about the norms in our community in the form of abstract rules (e.g., popular refrains), but the deeper learning only happens through practice, including, as a matter of necessity, breakdowns. We should not be afraid of ethical breakdowns. #LinguisticBodies"
"[E]thical stance is a practical one, a type of ethical know-how. We should think of it as a form of expertise, like riding a bicycle, with the double implication that we can be more or less ethically skillful &amp; that our ethical attitudes are often prereflective. #LinguisticBodies"
"While the vulnerabilities listed indicate that there are “bad” ways of existing as #LinguisticBodies—that is, ways that expose ling bodies to systematic risk and damage—it is perhaps misleading to think that one way of being a viable ling body is necessarily better than another."
"&lt;- Examples include exclusion, impairments to participation, lack of recognition, not being skillful in a foreign language or the language of a subcommunity, neurophysiological impairments, mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, trauma. #LinguisticBodies"
"The specific vulnerabilities of ling bodies include systematic impairments of ling becoming (isolation, neurological conditions), taking the form of systematic affronts to their integrity &amp; processes of reaffirmation (both as capable ling agents &amp; as belonging to a community)."
"Linguistic bodies are vulnerable in ways that surpass sensorimotor or organic vulnerabilities (even though these vulnerabilities become inextricably entangled). -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
The integrity of linguistic bodies depends on the exercise of certain forms of agency and participation in community practices. It is also a consequence of the activity and attitudes of others. #LinguisticBodies
The tensions that must be navigated by linguistic bodies arise from joint histories of linguistic becoming and from the living stream of languaging in a community. #LinguisticBodies
Linguistic bodies are nourished by communal and interpersonal relations. Identity processes in linguistic bodies are therefore complex and relational. #LinguisticBodies
"&lt;- On the contrary, ethical concern is the essence of every linguistic act, whether oriented toward other linguistic bodies, toward the self, or toward the world. #LinguisticBodies"
"Ethical concern is not something that is added to already constituted linguistic bodies, as sociocultural normativity is supposedly added to a presumed original nature in dualistic thought. -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
"Linguistic practice is a practice of otherness and, as such, involves inherently ethical concerns. To become a linguistic body is to place oneself in a responsible relation of care about others and concern for others. #LinguisticBodies"
"Our understanding of linguistic communities, of the continuities between life and language, implies that language is a field of struggle. Entrenched perspectives  will never be really challenged if we do not learn to speak differently. #LinguisticBodies"
A concern for enactivists is that theories of life and mind should avoid obfuscating this inherent ethical stance. Obfuscation occurs if we choose the wrong language or do not dare to push existing categories outside their frames when this is called for. #LinguisticBodies
"Immediately, this entails an ethical stance toward our objects of study, which is also a stance toward life, human beings, our own activity as practitioners of research, and the world we inhabit. #LinguisticBodies"
"Ethical concerns follow directly from the heart of the enactive approach. We care about life and about the world because we are precarious organic, sensorimotor, and intersubjective bodies. #LinguisticBodies"
It is our responsibility to express as clearly as possible and to critically examine our own ideological framework and be skeptical of those who claim they haven’t got any.  #LinguisticBodies
"In fact, non-neutrality characterizes as much the content as the epistemic attitude of the enactive program. #LinguisticBodies"
"The very attempt at formulating a truly embodied, nonrepresentationalist approach to language is non-neutral, even if it might seem to belong exclusively to the realm of dry academic debates. #LinguisticBodies"
"There is no neutral perspective on how we decide to study the human mind; nothing is just the way it is, untouched by an ideology. #LinguisticBodies https://t.co/X9N8yYsa3I"

"End of ch 11, #LinguisticBodies  

Ch 12, the last chapter and one of my favourite chapters of the book, next weekend."
&lt;- This passage to language as a powerful and manipulable voice/text of a community leads us directly to face the ethical and political dimensions of our account of linguistic bodies. #LinguisticBodies
"While remaining interactive in nature, language thus freed is no longer easily owned or authored, but it becomes a way a community as a whole talks and writes to itself. #LinguisticBodies"
"In reading, a linguistic body enacts herself through engagements with the utterances of another. In reading, one is also writing. In writing, one is also reading &amp; inevitably deploying utterances of another, styles of another (not just one particular other), styles of a genre."
"Writing and reading, we may conclude, are particularly powerful modes in which material practices give rise to ideality. #LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- Gestures are probably some of the clearer exemplars of this openness. But like spoken words, they might lead us to think that openness somehow goes together with the fleeting temporality and materiality of action, of moves and sounds. #LinguisticBodies"
"Even if the words in an utterance stick to their dictionary meanings and the phrasing is commonplace, there is, because of their materiality, always an openness in the moves and sounds that do the symbolizing in linguistic encounters. -&gt; 

#LinguisticBodies"
"What scholars call grammar has a basis in the real life of linguistic practices. Symbols materialize virtual relations that emerge out of the open dialectics of spontaneity and sedimentation.
#LinguisticBodies"
"&lt;- Such is the case of graphic marks, engravings, tools, artifacts, places, and arrangements of objects produced or used as symbolic constraints on action. #LinguisticBodies"
"The material instantiation of some symbols, however, allows their constraining effects to endure beyond the acts that produced them, to suspend in time the matching of partial acts of participatory sense-making. #LinguisticBodies"
"All living symbols, like all acts, are material, whether spoken or gestured, whether propped up by tools, objects, buildings, star constellations, or bits of the landscape. #LinguisticBodies"
"A gestalt switch is called for: let us not talk about “reference” “rules” “content” “symbol” or “well-formedness judgments” but about referring, regulating, judging, symbolizing &amp; sensitizing &amp; thus be able to preserve the materiality, agency, &amp; susceptibility of these processes."
"Nonrepresentational explanations of reference &amp; content, normativity and intentionality, are viable when these phenomena are understood as living, dynamic activities of precarious bodies situated in—that is, sensitive to &amp; powerful in—social and semiotic space. #LinguisticBodies"
Meaning applies to and happens for whole situated organisms. #LinguisticBodies
"&lt;- imperatives, topics and comments, and so on, helps to shape novel forms of sensorimotor sense-making. #LinguisticBodies"
"Just as linguistic bodies are grounded on the sensorimotor dimension of embodiment, so the shared grammatical know-how for structuring utterances into sequences, embeddings, correspondences, conjugations, relatively fixed and variable combinations, interrogatives, -&gt;"
The effects of emergent grammars of interaction that sediment into community norms extend beyond what is typically considered the domain of linguistic behavior.  #LinguisticBodies
"&lt;- projects through linguistics and other semiotic means. As a result of this continuous process, regularities emerge and rules of linguistic behavior get established and conventionalized” Linell in #LinguisticBodies"
"“We do not first have a grammar a priori, and then start building utterances in accordance with it. Instead, we are always immersed in languaging, in and through which we develop habits of using and reusing elements of language and routines of enacting communicative -&gt;"
"From an enactive perspective, linguistic norms should not be understood so much in terms of rules of grammar or lexicography as typically studied by the science of linguistics. Such categories ultimately derive from more fun damental autonomous patterns in a linguistic community."
[W]e present living emergent embodied grammar—enactive grammar—as a general concept that further work could link with more specific aspects of grammar as studied by linguists. #LinguisticBodies
"&lt;- In both cases what is missing is traveling the road from the general to the particular, which is of course work to be done. #LinguisticBodies"
"Just as somebody studying the role of the gaze in interactions may find that participatory sense-making does not directly formulate an answer to her questions, somebody interested in ergative languages may find our emergent grammar falls somehow short of her target."
"We are proposing general concepts grounded on our account of linguistic bodies, which is itself grounded on the life-mind continuity. In offering our account of grammaticalizing, we have not stepped out of this continuity. #LinguisticBodies"
"[w]e sketch an enactive take on symbolizing, gesturing, and reading and storytelling. We recommend that readers not expect that from this point we will derive everything that students of grammars (or narratives, etc.) study. #LinguisticBodies"
"Chapter 11: an account of living, emergent grammar. #LinguisticBodies"
